<span class="firstWord">If</span>
you wish to be relieved from the worries of
housekeeping; if you wish to cultivate the society
of retired army folk, or that of blameless spinsterhood,
ask for a room (inclusive terms) at the
Kensington Park Hotel, Kensington. It is unprogressive,
it is Early Victorian&mdash;though of late that
term has lost some of its reproach&mdash;but it is
eminently safe and respectable.
</p>

<p>
Although neither of these qualities had ever
particularly attracted Lady Gregory&mdash;or Madame
Claire, as her grandchildren called her&mdash;she
found herself at the age of seventy a candidate
for admission. It was out of the question
for her to keep up the big house in Prince&rsquo;s Gardens
after her only son Eric married. Live with
him she would not, valuing his love for her and
his own happiness too much to risk a m&eacute;nage-&agrave;-trois
with a daughter-in-law&mdash;even a daughter-in-law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">2</a></span>
of whom at that time she approved. For
Madame Claire not only faced facts squarely,
but she had a way of seeing under and around
them as well, which greatly endeared her to the
more discriminating of her children and grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
It was eight years since Eric had married
Louise Broughton, and eight years since Madame
Claire had come to live at the Kensington Park
Hotel. Her little suite was arranged with
charming taste. Guests of the hotel were not
encouraged to furnish their own rooms, but Madame
Claire had succeeded little by little in ousting
the hotel atrocities and had put in their place
some favorite pieces left from the sale of the
house in Prince&rsquo;s Gardens. Her meals were
served in her sitting-room by Dawson, her elderly
maid, and there too she held her little court.
She had a great pity for other old ladies less
fortunately placed, who were obliged to be in,
yet not of, the homes of their children or grandchildren&mdash;&ldquo;Always
there, like pieces of furniture.
Whereas,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;if my family
wish to see me they must come to me, and make
an occasion of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A wonderful woman she was then at seventy-eight,
with all her senses very much on the alert.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">3</a></span>
She read a great deal, but thought more, looking
out of her windows at the world. She usually
dressed in gray or dark blue, avoiding black which
she said was only for the young. She was more
nearly beautiful at seventy-eight than at any other
period of her life, though she had always been
a woman of great charm. She had been a loved
and invaluable wife to the late Sir Robert Gregory,
whom the world knew best as ambassador
to Italy. She often said that for the connoisseur
there were only two countries, England and
Italy.
</p>

<p>
When Robert Gregory died, leaving her a
widow of sixty, she was speedily&mdash;too speedily
some said&mdash;sought in marriage by their lifelong
friend, Stephen de Lisle. That was eighteen
years ago. Refused by her, and perhaps made to
feel just a little an old fool, he went abroad in
one of his black tempers, and she had not heard
one word from him since. It was a great sorrow
to her, for both she and her husband had loved
him devotedly. The grandchildren, especially
Judy and Noel, thought it a delightful romance.
They liked having a grandmother who had refused
a famous man at sixty and broken his heart.
But it was a subject on which she would permit
no affectionate comment. It would have meant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">4</a></span>
so much to her to have had him as a dear contemporary
and friend.
</p>

<p>
One foggy morning in late December when the
whole world seemed bounded by the thick yellow
fog which pressed against her window panes,
Dawson brought her a letter bearing a French
stamp. She knew the handwriting at once, though
it had been firmer in the old days. She read a
few lines of it, then stopped and turned to her
maid who was busy about the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dawson,&rdquo; said Madame Claire in a voice that
was far from steady, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a letter from Mr.
de Lisle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, m&rsquo;lady!&rdquo; cried Dawson who loved surprises,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like a voice from the grave, isn&rsquo;t it
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not well,&rdquo; continued her mistress, reading
on. &ldquo;Gout he says, poor old thing. He
writes from Cannes, where he&rsquo;s gone for the
sunshine. He has to have a nurse. How he
must hate it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you as strong and well as ever,&rdquo; exulted
Dawson. It was a source of peculiar joy to her
when any of Madame Claire&rsquo;s contemporaries
fell victims to the maladies of old age, or that
severest malady of all, death. Her beloved mistress
seemed to her then like the winner in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">5</a></span>
great race, and who was she, Dawson, but the
groom who tended and groomed the racer? She
thrilled with pride.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire read the letter through to the
end, and then went at once to her desk, with as
free a step, Dawson thought, as she had ever had.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must write to him immediately,&rdquo; she said,
a flush on her old cheeks.
</p>

<p>
The letter took her several hours to write,
because there was so much to tell him. He kept
it, as he kept all her letters, and when he died
they came into Eric&rsquo;s possession, and finally into
the writer&rsquo;s.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">
&ldquo;My dear old Stephen,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">she wrote,</span>
</p>

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;Nothing that has happened to me in the
last ten years has given me as much pleasure as
your letter from Cannes. After a silence a fifth
of a century long, you have come alive for me
again. Stephen, Stephen! How am I to forgive
you for that silence? But I do forgive you,
as you knew I would, and I thank you for the
happiness you have given me by breaking it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you have changed much, though
you say you are an invalid&mdash;gout, phlebitis, rheumatism!
Infirm, crotchety old Stephen! Infirm
as to legs, but very active, I gather, as to brain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">6</a></span>
heart, and temper. How I wish we might see
each other! But you cannot travel, and I&mdash;yes,
I can, but I will not. I motor gently down to my
little house in Sussex in the summer, and back
again in the autumn, and that is enough. The
rest of the time I dwell in peace and security in
three rooms here at the Kensington Park Hotel,
and it suits me very well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How good it is that we can pick up the
threads of our friendship again! As far as I am
concerned it has neither lapsed nor waned. You
say I dealt you a great blow. But, Stephen, how
could you expect Robert&rsquo;s widow, already a grandmother,
to have married again? That, my dearest
friend, would have been an elderly folly for
which I would never have forgiven myself. You
sulked badly, Stephen, and I think now you owe
it to your years and mine to laugh. Do laugh!
There is nothing like the mirth of old age, for
old age knows why it laughs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You say you want me to write you about
everything that concerns myself. I know you are
only trying to cover up your tracks here, for the
one you really want to hear about is Judy. I am
well aware of your elderly partiality for my
granddaughter, with whom you fell in love when
she was seven&mdash;twenty years ago. But I don&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">7</a></span>
intend to pander to it at the expense of the others.
Judy must take her turn along with the rest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stephen, would you be young again? You,
thinking of your gout and your phlebitis, would
cry &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; But don&rsquo;t you see that you would
merely be inviting gout and phlebitis again? For
myself, the answer is no, no, no! And I have
been happy, too, and with reason. Not for anything
would I be blind again, uncertain, groping;
feeling my way, wondering where my duty lay,
dreading the blows of fate before they struck,
valuing happiness too highly. That is life.
Now the turmoil has died down, confusion is no
more. It&rsquo;s like sitting on a quiet hilltop in the
light of the setting sun. Fate cannot harm me&mdash;I
have lived. There is nothing to be feared, and
there is nothing to be expected except the kindly
hand of death, and the opening of another door.
Perhaps one is a little tired, but the climb, after
all, was worth it, and one can think here, and
listen to the cries of birds, and the sound of the
wind in the grass. The lie of the land over which
one has come taken a different aspect and falls
into a pattern. Those woods where one felt so
lost&mdash;how little they were, and how many openings
they had, if one had only gone forward,
instead of rushing in blind circles.&hellip;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">8</a></span>
&ldquo;Gordon, my tactless grandson, said the other
day that no one would dream I was nearly eighty
if it were not for the evidence of the family tree.
That did not please me. I take as much pride in
being nearly eighty as I once took in being sixteen.
After all, being an old woman is my r&ocirc;le
at present, and naturally it is a r&ocirc;le I wish to
play well. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll say that I would accept
old age less philosophically if I were blind, or
deaf, or bedridden. I wonder? Even without
all one&rsquo;s faculties, surely there are thoughts and
memories enough to furnish the mind. (Why,
why, Stephen, don&rsquo;t we cultivate
<em>contemplation</em>?)
And that tantalizing veil that shuts us
off from the beyond should be wearing thin at our
age, so that by watching and waiting one should
be able to catch glimpses of what it hides.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now you will say, &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake
stop moralizing and tell me about Judy.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hate describing people&mdash;especially those I
love, but I will try. She is lovely in her strange
way, with moments of real beauty. I say strange,
because she follows no accepted rules. She is
somber, but lights up charmingly when she smiles.
I suppose her mouth is too wide, but I like it.
She, is dark&mdash;the sort of girl who wears tawny
colors well. She has brains and humor and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">9</a></span>
responsiveness is not even second to Eric. Her
mother, my daughter Millicent whom you will of
course remember, is foolishly trying to goad her
into marriage. How I pity youth! It&rsquo;s so vulnerable!
Judy tells me she sometimes wakes at
night in a sort of fever, hagridden by the thought
that she may have made a mess of her life by not
marrying this man or that, fearful that she may
never meet the right one at all, hating the thought
of spinsterhood, and, she says, seeing nothing else
for it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; you may ask, &lsquo;are all the young men
about?&rsquo; Well, we lost many of our best in the
war, as you and I know full well, and Judy expects&mdash;everything&mdash;And
why not, as she has
everything to give? She is not a girl to make
concessions easily. Noel, her younger brother, is
a great joy to her. Do you remember Noel, or
can you only remember Judy? He was a dear
little boy in those days, with his prickly, unusual
notions, and his elfishness. He is not exactly
good-looking, but his height, and his extremely
attractive smile make him at least noticeable. He
lost his left arm in France, and is now finding it
very difficult to fit into a job. His health was so
bad before the war that he had never settled down
to anything, and the doctors had frightened him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">10</a></span>
and all of us into the belief that a severe winter
cold would kill him. Then the war came, and
three winters in the trenches made a new man of
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gordon, of course, went back to the Foreign
Office, where he seems perfectly happy. He will
never fit his grandfather&rsquo;s shoes, however. Robert
had more wit in his little finger than Gordon
has in his handsome head&mdash;but it is a very handsome
head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know that I am practicing great self-restraint?
I have hardly mentioned your godson
Eric&mdash;for fear, perhaps, of saying too much. He
was away at school when you were last here, so
he must be a very shadowy figure to you. He
might have been like a son to you all these years,
if only you had not cut yourself adrift from us all.
For five years, you say, you have been almost
within a day&rsquo;s journey of England without once
crossing the Channel. And yet time was when
London was like a ball at your feet. Your great
fault, Stephen, is that you take defeat badly. I
still believe that you could have turned your political
reverse at least into victory if you had
stayed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At forty-one Eric is very like what Robert
was at that age, but more dynamic. Keep that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">11</a></span>
word in mind if you would know him. He infuses
life into me through his voice, through his smile,
through his intensely blue eyes. He is impetuous
and headlong&mdash;but headlong always on the side
of fairness. He has his father&rsquo;s quick grasp of
things. He is tremendously interested in what
you say&mdash;in what he says&mdash;and in you. When
he smiles he makes you smile, when he laughs you
must laugh too. He treats me as if I were an
interesting old friend whom he likes, as well as
his mother whom he loves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His wife&mdash;he married Louise Broughton, the
daughter of old Admiral Broughton&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t in
the least understand him. If I have a regret in
the world it is that. But I will tell you more
about her another time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now a few words about Millicent whom
you knew as a sedate young matron. She is still
sedate. She is in fact the very embodiment of all
that is correct and conventional (I almost said
and dull) in the English character. By that I
mean that she is always well-poised and completely
mistress of herself whether at Court or in
her nightdress in an open boat. (Where indeed
she was, poor thing, for she was torpedoed crossing
from America during the war. She had gone
there to raise funds for the Belgians. An eye-witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
told me she presided all the time, especially
when it came to handing round the rum and
biscuits. She was always a good, if stiff, hostess.
He said that her nightdress, barely covered by a
waterproof and a lifebelt, became by some miracle
of deportment a quite proper and suitable
garment, and made the women who were wrapped
in furs look overdressed. I can imagine it perfectly.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never outgrown a feeling of amazement
at having achieved anything as correct as
Millicent. She is always certain she is right, and
she never sees obstacles. When Gordon, Eric,
and Noel went to the war she never worried, but
looked quite calmly to their safe return, completely
ignoring the awful and uncertain ground
between. I believe she thought that the Almighty
had a special mission to look after Pendletons
and Gregorys. It seems she had some grounds
for her belief, only Judy says she forgot to concentrate
on Noel&rsquo;s arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;John, her husband, is as negligible as ever.
I cannot think what you found in him to dislike,
unless you, like Nature, abhor a vacuum.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As for Connie&mdash;my poor Connie! Stephen,
I don&rsquo;t know where she is, nor whether she&rsquo;s alive
or dead.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">13</a></span>
&ldquo;Get better of your gout and the other things,
and come to England. After all, there is no place
like it. Although we are in the midst of winter
and coal is scarce and dear, and though the descendants
of the daughters of the horseleech
have multiplied exceedingly and cry louder than
ever, &lsquo;Give, give, give!&rsquo; And although even the
children nowadays seem to lisp in grumbles, for
the grumbles come, it is still the best country in
the world and you must come back to it and take
it to your heart again before&mdash;but you hate the
thought of that, so I won&rsquo;t say the words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will write again next week; there is so much
to tell you. So good-bye, for now.

<p><span class="firstWord">Dawson</span>
thought her mistress must have begun
to write her &ldquo;memoyers,&rdquo; she wrote so long. She
said as much to Judy and Noel when they came
to pay Madame Claire a visit the next day. They
were much interested in the news. Judy remembered
&ldquo;Old Stephen,&rdquo; as she had called him years
ago, and identified him by describing a mole that
he had on one cheek. It was her first experience
with moles, and for a long time after she confused
that little mound on his face, with the bigger
mounds the moles made in the lawn, and
thought that a much smaller animal of the same
species must have been to blame for it.
</p>

<p>
As a child she had an extraordinary memory&mdash;a
memory that seemed to go beyond the things
of this life. She came trailing clouds of glory in
a way that used to alarm her mother and delight
her grandmother. Millicent was quite shocked at
a question of hers when she was four.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mummy, whose little girl was I before I was
yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Of course Millicent answered:
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">15</a></span>
&ldquo;Little silly, you&rsquo;ve always been my little girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Judy wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it, and shook her
head till the curls flew.
</p>

<p>
When her grandmother questioned her about it,
she would only repeat:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was another mummy under the big tree.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millicent was convinced that she only said it
to annoy.
</p>

<p>
Noel too had little peculiarities as a child.
Loud music always hurt his eyes, he said, and
when he heard a noisy brass band he would shut
them tightly and cry out:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hideous! It&rsquo;s so red. I hate that color.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He always saw color in music and heard music
in color, and never knew that he was different
from other people until he went to school, and
there the boys teased him out of it. Think of the
individual oddnesses that are strangled (for better
or for worse) in school! Limbo must be full
of childish conceits and strange gleams of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
On that particular afternoon the two of them
amused their grandmother even more than usual.
They had no secrets from Madame Claire, which
of course is the greatest compliment the young
can pay to the old.
</p>

<p>
The subject of Judy&rsquo;s spinsterhood was introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">16</a></span>
by her brother. She had refused a friend
of his a week before, and he pretended that the
situation seriously alarmed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a man on the tapis at present,&rdquo;
he told Madame Claire. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s given poor old
Pat Enderby his walking papers, and I&rsquo;m hanged
if I know what she&rsquo;s going to do now. There
isn&rsquo;t even a nibble that I&rsquo;m aware of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Judy from the other end
of the sofa, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got till I&rsquo;m thirty-five. That&rsquo;s
nearly eight years. If I don&rsquo;t find somebody by
that time, I&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m not intended for matrimony.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every woman is intended for matrimony,&rdquo;
said her brother judicially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense. And anyway,&rdquo; Judy defended
herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no intention of rushing
about looking for a husband. I&rsquo;m quite content
to stay single as long as I have you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; said Noel unfeelingly. &ldquo;I want a lot
of nephews and nieces, and Gordon&rsquo;s would be
such awful prigs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So might mine be,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no telling, apparently. Who&rsquo;d think that Mother
was Madame Claire&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if they were prigs, their Uncle Noel
would soon knock it out of them. Besides, provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">17</a></span>
you don&rsquo;t marry a prig&mdash;which heaven forbid,
there&rsquo;s no reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t be regular
young devils.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to be well up in eugenics, Noel,&rdquo;
observed Madame Claire, her eyes twinkling.
She was sitting near the fire in an old chair with
a high, carved back. She loved their nonsense,
and liked to spur them on to greater absurdities.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He thinks he is,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;But honestly,
spinsterhood is fast losing its terrors for me.
One ought to be proud of it, and put it after one&rsquo;s
name, like an order of merit. I shall begin signing
myself, &lsquo;Judy Pendleton, V.F.C.&rsquo; Virgin
From Choice. Doesn&rsquo;t it sound charming?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Noel. &ldquo;I certainly
wouldn&rsquo;t advertise the fact. I think spinsterhood
is awful. I believe I&rsquo;d rather see you a lady of
easy virtue than a spinster, Judy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Noel!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;And before
Madame Claire!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; scoffed Noel. &ldquo;Besides,
she agrees with me. Don&rsquo;t you, Madame
Claire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She appeared to consider the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think spinsterhood would be less dull, in the
long run,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;After all, no one is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">18</a></span>
freer from ties&mdash;if that is a desirable thing&mdash;than
the modern unmarried woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Judy seconded her. &ldquo;Noel&rsquo;s point
of view is ridiculously young. Personally I could
be quite content if I had some money of my own,
freedom, and a few friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bosh,&rdquo; spoke man through the mouth of Noel.
&ldquo;If you mean to include men friends, let me tell
you that men are afraid of unmarried women over
thirty-five or so. They can&rsquo;t make them out.
Neither fish, flesh, nor fowl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy did not pretend to dislike men.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a dreadful thought,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
Tea arrived at this point, and Noel proceeded
to make absurd conversation with Dawson, who
had known the brother and sister from babyhood.
Absurd, at least, on his part, but perfectly serious
on hers. She always asked him how his arm was,
meaning, presumably, the place where they took
it off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendid, thanks, Dawes,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to give me a new one soon, I&rsquo;m
glad to say. They make wonderful artificial
limbs now, that can do most anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So they tell me, Mr. Noel,&rdquo; said Dawson,
arranging the tea things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the one I&rsquo;m going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">19</a></span>
to have knows all about raising chickens. It&rsquo;s
trained specially. I&rsquo;m thinking of going in for
chicken farming, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that a fact, Mr. Noel?&rdquo; breathed Dawson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; went on the deceiver of women.
&ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t know a thing about chickens,
and all I&rsquo;ll have to do will be just to follow my
arm about, so to speak. It can tell the age of a
pullet to a day, just by pulling its leg. That&rsquo;s
why they call a young hen a pullet, you know. As
for eggs, it can find &rsquo;em anywhere. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter how cleverly the old hens hide them, this
arm of mine can smell &rsquo;em out as quick as winking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dawson gaped with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never would have believed it, would you,
m&rsquo;lady?&rdquo; exclaimed the dear old London-bred
soul. &rdquo;They do invent wonderful things these
days, don&rsquo;t they now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; went on Noel mercilessly.
&ldquo;A chap I know lost both his legs in the
war. He never was much of a sportsman, but he
made up his mind he&rsquo;d like to go in for golf. So
they made him a specially trained pair of golf
legs, and hang it all! the poor fellow has to play
all day long now. The worst of it is he doesn&rsquo;t
care much about it, now that he&rsquo;s had a taste of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">20</a></span>
it. Bores him, he says. But those blessed legs
of his, they take him off to the golf links rain or
shine, every day of his life; and they won&rsquo;t let him
off at nine holes, either. Has to play the whole
blooming eighteen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point, Dawson&rsquo;s slow mind gave birth
to a faint suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Mr. Noel,&rdquo; she said, her plain old face
red with one of her easy blushes, &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re
just having me on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said he, looking the
picture of earnest candor, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t heard the
half of it yet. Why, another chap I know had
even worse luck than that. Nice fellow, too&mdash;has
a wife and family. He lost his right arm. Well,
they made a mistake with him and sent him an
arm that was specially designed for another chap&mdash;a
Colonel in the War Office&mdash;devil of a fellow
and all that. Would you believe it, every time my
friend went near a Wraf or a Waac, that arm of
his nearly jumped out of its socket trying to get
round the girl&rsquo;s waist? Awkward, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dawson&rsquo;s expression was almost too much for
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so cut up about it, Dawes,&rdquo; he
said, reaching for a cake. &ldquo;It all came out right
in the end. He and the Colonel swapped arms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">21</a></span>
and so he got his own, finally. It was specially
designed for spanking the kids, and as the Colonel
was a bachelor it was no good to him. So
they both lived happy ever after.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dawson was on her way to the door. Before
making her exit, she turned her crimson face toward
Madame Claire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do wish, m&rsquo;lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d tell
Mr. Noel there&rsquo;s some things that ought to be
sacred. And I&rsquo;ll say this, Mr. Noel. The arm
you want is one that&rsquo;ll pinch you when you tell
fibs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good old Dawes,&rdquo; commented Noel between
mouthfuls. &ldquo;She generally manages to get her
own back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy and Noel were much interested at this
time in Eric&rsquo;s matrimonial affairs. Noel especially
was convinced that he and Louise were on
the verge of a smash-up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to happen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
tension in that house is too awful. Dining there
is like sitting over a live bomb and counting the
seconds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how Eric stands it,&rdquo; said Judy.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be an explosion. Nothing so
dramatic. What I dread most isn&rsquo;t a smash-up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">22</a></span>
but a freezing-up. Like the Nortons&rsquo;, Judy. Do
you remember how they avoided each other&rsquo;s eyes,
and never laughed, nor even smiled? Their very
faces became frozen. It was terrible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would take a considerable frost to freeze
Eric,&rdquo; Judy remarked with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; assented her grandmother.
&ldquo;What I most admire about him is that he&rsquo;s always
ready to discuss peace. He&rsquo;s always hoping
for signs of friendliness from the enemy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She treats him like a red-headed stepson,&rdquo;
Noel said indignantly. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d only begun by
beating her now and then&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire felt bound to make out a case
for her daughter-in-law.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She married the wrong man&mdash;for her&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
When Noel and Judy had gone, Madame
Claire sat thinking about Eric and his unfortunate
marriage. He was, as she had called him in her
letter, dynamic. He was as impulsive and full
of the love of life as his wife was joyless and cold.
His chief charm lay in his perfectly sincere interest
in everything and everybody. His mind was
as elastic as his muscles, which were famous at
Oxford, and while his wife found most things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">23</a></span>
rather tedious, to him there was nothing old under
the sun.
</p>

<p>
He thought he had married a charming girl,
and indeed, for a while, she had charm. During
his impetuous pursuit of her&mdash;for some instinct
told her that the more she eluded him, the more
eagerly he would pursue&mdash;she assumed a delicate
sparkle that became her well. He could even
remember a day when she threw out an alluring
glow at which a hopeful lover might warm his
hands, but it soon died, and the sparkle with it.
Love may have told her how to spread the net,
but of the cage in which to keep him she knew
less than nothing.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire understood better than any one
else that he felt ties of the spirit far more than
he felt ties of the flesh. That peculiarity he had
inherited from her, for she had often been heard
to say that she loved Eric because he was Eric
and not because she had borne him. She declared
that her affection for Judy and Noel was
entirely due to their own charm and attraction
for her, and had nothing to do with the fact that
they were her grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Though I am very glad they were,&rdquo; she would
say, &ldquo;for in that way intimacy has been made
easy for us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">24</a></span>
With her daughter Millicent she had nothing
in common but the blood tie, and though she
rarely confessed it, there were times when it irked
her.
</p>

<p>
And so her son found it impossible to be the
conventional husband who takes his wife for
granted. He never took Louise for granted for
a single instant, and it shocked her. He treated
her with the same courtesy and studied her moods
as diligently as if she had been some one else&rsquo;s
wife. When he made her a present, which he
liked to do, he expected her to show the same
pleasure in the gift that she would have shown
before their marriage. As for her, she would
have asked for nothing better than to settle down
into the take-everything-for-granted matrimonial
jog-trot. When the clergyman pronounced them
man and wife, he said, so far as Louise was concerned,
the last word on the subject. Spiritual
marriage was an undreamt of thing. She expected
her husband to be faithful to her and to
look up to her, because, after all, she came of one
of the oldest families in England. So they were
rapidly growing apart. Threads had become
twisted and lines of communication broken. And
there seemed no good reason for it all. There
was still a spark among the cooling embers, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">25</a></span>
some wind that was needed to blow upon it had
shifted and gone elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
There were no children&mdash;which was a greater
sorrow to Eric than to the empty-handed Louise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A figurehead of a wife,&rdquo; Judy called her, and
it was true enough.
</p>

<p>
They lived in a charming house in Brook Street,
which Louise complained wasn&rsquo;t big enough to
entertain in, and was too big to say you couldn&rsquo;t
entertain in. She had left the furnishing of it
to Eric, admitting her own deficiency in the matter
of taste. She bitterly resented his unerring
instinct for the best thing and the right thing; a
gift, she chose to maintain, it was unmanly to
possess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was marrying a decorator,&rdquo;
she was fond of saying.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Stephen de Lisle&rsquo;s</span>
second letter, eagerly looked
for by Madame Claire, came the following week.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">
&ldquo;Dear Claire,
</p>
<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;Thank God for your letter. It&rsquo;s put new
life into me; and I assure you, I needed it. Of
course it&rsquo;s all tommyrot what you say about old
age. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to run and jump about
again, and be able to digest anything, and sit up
late at night? I think this having to be coddled
and looked after is an infernal nuisance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I was a fool to take your refusal as I
did, but that can&rsquo;t be helped now. You forgive
me, and besides, I know well enough the loss was
mine. But I couldn&rsquo;t have endured London all
these years. Too many people, too much noise,
and too much dirt. Still, I may, gout and rheumatism
permitting, come to see you and my godson
and the grandchildren yet. I&rsquo;m glad you
remembered how fond I was of that child Judy.
Most attractive child I ever saw. Twenty-seven,
you say? It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible. Don&rsquo;t let
her get married in a hurry. She is perfectly right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">27</a></span>
to wait for the real thing. Instinct is the lead
to follow, and hers is a right one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was a wonderful letter of yours, Claire.
I hope there will be many more. They give me
something to look forward to. I haven&rsquo;t a half
dozen young people about me as you have. I&rsquo;ve
one niece, Monica de Lisle. Ugly, churchy, uninteresting
female. You may remember her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cannes is delightful, but alas! I am too old
to enjoy more than the sun and the color of the
sky. How do you manage to keep so young in
your mind? Bob used to say you&rsquo;d die young if
you lived to be a hundred, and he was right.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reading Shakespeare mostly. I find the
old ones the best, and he&rsquo;s the best of the old
ones. Omniscient, he was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, write again soon. Don&rsquo;t tire
yourself, but&mdash;write soon. Do you remember old
Jock Wetherby? He&rsquo;s here at this hotel. Tottering
on the brink, and ten years my junior.
Drink&mdash;women&mdash;all the cheapening vices. Looks
it, too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about Judy and the others.
</p>
</div>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;Yours ever,</p>
<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="post-script">
&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got the ugliest nurse in Christendom.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">28</a></span>
Madame Claire read extracts from this letter
to Judy, who was immensely pleased at the impression
she must have made.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Though what he saw in me, I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;My chief points, judging from photographs,
were shoe-button eyes, a fringe, and a
prominent stomach. But there&rsquo;s no accounting
for these infatuations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do wish he would come to London,&rdquo; said
Madame Claire as she folded the letter. &ldquo;After
all, London is the best place for old people. They
get more consideration here than anywhere else
in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Kensington Park Hotel certainly harbored
its share. On those rare occasions when Madame
Claire took a meal in the dining-room she was
always struck by the number of white, gray, or
shining pink heads to be seen. And the faces that
went with them were usually placid and content.
In the lounge at tea-time they fought the war over
again, they made or unmade political reputations,
they discussed the food, the latest play, and most
of all they discussed&mdash;the women at least&mdash;Royalty
and the nobility. Not even in the drawing-rooms
of the very great were exalted names so
freely and intimately spoken of. One old dame
with an ear trumpet, who later comes into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">29</a></span>
story, had once or twice, at Judy&rsquo;s or Noel&rsquo;s request,
been invited into Madame Claire&rsquo;s sitting
room. Noel called her the Semaphore. From
her they learned what it was the Royal family
had for breakfast the morning war was declared,
or what Princess Mary said to young Lord B&mdash;&mdash;
when he trod on her toe at a dance. How these
stray bits of gossip or surmise ever filtered their
way down the old lady&rsquo;s ear trumpet was a mystery
to every one. She was an old woman of
strange importance. She envied no one under
Heaven. She possessed a small black instrument
that seemed to be the focusing point of every fine
wire of invention. She seemed to be the central
office of the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;They Say&rdquo; bureau. No one
was ever rude to her, and no one, except perhaps
Madame Claire and her grandchildren, ever
really disbelieved her, because hardly any one does
altogether disbelieve rumors, even when they
come from such a source. Her greatness of
course was at its height during the war, when she
was generously supplied with the most astounding
pieces of secret information by obliging young
nephews. However, she bore the flatness of
peace with serenity, contenting herself with the
doings of the great. Of such, with variations, is
the kingdom of Kensington!
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">30</a></span>
A day or two later Eric and Louise came together
to see Madame Claire. It was so long
since they had done this that she felt a little
flutter of hope, believing that it indicated a better
state of things between them. But she found soon
enough that she was wrong. Louise was possessed&mdash;in
the sense that people one reads of in
the Bible were possessed&mdash;by her own special
demon of jealousy.
</p>

<p>
She was not jealous of any other woman&mdash;it
was far less simple than that. She was jealous
of the ease with which her husband made friends,
of his popularity, of his charm. They had been
guests at a rather political house party, where
Eric was unmistakably the center of attraction.
She was aware that she had been more tolerated
than liked, and the knowledge did not contribute
to her peace of mind. She was determined to
make him feel (on any grounds whatsoever) inferior
to her. She could understand and respect
superiority of birth, but she distrusted and resented
superiority of intellect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A most successful week-end,&rdquo; Eric told his
mother, drawing up a chair beside hers. &ldquo;Their
house is lovely, and I am very fond of them all.
I should like to think that I am one-half as good
a host as Charles Murray-Carstairs.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">31</a></span>
&ldquo;I am glad you both enjoyed it,&rdquo; said Madame
Claire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Both?&rdquo; Her daughter-in-law gave a short
laugh. &ldquo;Candidly I was bored to tears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise was meant to be a pretty woman, but
having a regular profile and an English wild rose
complexion, she relied upon them to pull her
through, and wore her clothes as if she despised
them. Her hair was never quite tidy at the nape
of her neck, and her hats of this season were undistinguishable
from those of two seasons ago.
She took a pride in her lack of smartness, and had
a curious and mysterious belief that it was both
unladylike and unpatriotic to dress in the fashion.
Although she was only thirty-four, her girlishness
had gone so completely that it might never have
existed. The thin nostrils and small tight mouth
suggested the woman of fifty. She met Eric&rsquo;s
eyes with a look of antagonism.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what the visit was like, Madame
Claire. We couldn&rsquo;t go out because of the rain,
so Eric and Charles had time to ride all their
hobbies. We had old plate for luncheon, cricket
for tea, and politics for dinner. I don&rsquo;t know
what we had for breakfast. I was spared that
by not coming down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, mother,&rdquo; said Eric with a gesture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">32</a></span>
of the hands, &ldquo;the sufferings of a woman who
is married to a bore. I know of no case more
deserving of pity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the same,&rdquo; went on his wife,
&ldquo;whenever we go away together. But there are
always plenty of pretty women to hang upon his
words, Madame Claire, so it really doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now there,&rdquo; interrupted Eric with a smile,
&ldquo;there you are wrong. Never in my life have
enough pretty women hung upon my words to
satisfy me. I should like to see hundreds of them
so hanging, and the prettier the better. Inaccuracy,&rdquo;
he added, turning to his mother, &ldquo;is one of
Louise&rsquo;s greatest faults.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Louise,&rdquo; said Madame Claire, putting
a hand in one of Eric&rsquo;s, &ldquo;time was when you led
and others followed. You never used to be
shy. If you were bored with politics and old
silver&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shy,&rdquo; her daughter-in-law answered.
&ldquo;I think subjugated would be nearer the mark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eric took this up humorously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have subjugated Louise,&rdquo; he said with
mock pride. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to wager that no other
man could have done it under fifteen years, and it
has taken me only eight. And I&rsquo;ve never once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">33</a></span>
used the whip. Simply and solely the power of
the eye. I subjugate all my wives,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;I am a terrible fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He picked up and examined an old spoon that
lay on Madame Claire&rsquo;s table, and was about to
change the subject, when his wife&rsquo;s cold voice
interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t claim that you&rsquo;re any worse than
the general run of husbands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, my dear. I can only suppose that
you took one to yourself in a moment of weakness.&rdquo;
Then, throwing off his annoyance:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a charming spoon! It&rsquo;s Charles the
Second. You&rsquo;ve never shown me this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy gave it to me the other day,&rdquo; said Madame
Claire, her face brightening. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very
clever at picking up these things. But then&mdash;who
taught her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, you can&rsquo;t teach everybody,&rdquo; he answered,
turning it over in his fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, for instance, teach your wife,&rdquo;
threw in Louise. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing I have
learnt since my marriage, Madame Claire, and
that is my limitations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You underrate yourself, Louise,&rdquo; said Madame
Claire calmly. &ldquo;Do tell me about Gordon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">34</a></span>
Noel and Judy believe he&rsquo;s really interested in
Helen Dane. Do you think he is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there a great deal,&rdquo; answered Eric,
&ldquo;but then that may mean nothing. Ottway, her
father, is a good sort, but pompous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord Ottway has dignity, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean,&rdquo; said Louise. &ldquo;I hope Gordon does marry
Helen. It would be very suitable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As for suitable&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Madame
Claire, musingly. &ldquo;The girl seems a little hard&mdash;self-sufficient.
Still, I don&rsquo;t dislike her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only wish Judy would do as well,&rdquo; Louise
went on. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s almost certain to throw herself
away on some nobody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he were a nice nobody I shouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo;
said Madame Claire.
</p>

<p>
When Louise got up to go, Madame Claire
followed her into the bedroom where her fur coat
was. She longed to say something to her. She
felt that the words existed that might soften that
bitter mood, but she could not find the right ones.
She was sick at heart with anxiety. She knew
that Eric&rsquo;s patience was at breaking point, and
that he found his wife&rsquo;s sarcasm hard to bear.
Louise had only lately resorted to sarcasm&mdash;that
passing bell of love&mdash;and yet, underneath it all,
Madame Claire felt that she loved him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">35</a></span>
longed to be different, but that something&mdash;some
strange twist in her nature&mdash;would not let her.
She seemed to her like a woman pushing her frail
boat farther and farther out into a dangerous
current, and all the time crying weakly and piteously
for help. She doubted if that cry reached
any ears but hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am the only one who can help her,&rdquo; she
thought, and at the same time sent up a prayer
to the god who understands women&mdash;if such
there be.
</p>

<p>
A few days later she sent Louise a note, asking
her to come and see her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I can only avoid being mother-in-lawish,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;I may be able to accomplish something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise found her sitting in her high-backed
chair beside a wood fire. The room was full of
the scent of freesias, and she wore a few of them
in the front of her gray dress.
</p>

<p>
When Louise had put aside her wraps, Madame
Claire began to say what she had to say
without any unnecessary preliminaries.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louise, I particularly wanted a talk with you
to-day. I hope you&rsquo;ll be very frank with me, as
I mean to be very frank with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">36</a></span>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll always find me quite willing to
be frank,&rdquo; replied the younger woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well then. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me this.
Is Eric doing everything he possibly can to make
you happy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise raised her eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an odd question! Yes, I suppose he
is&mdash;as well as he knows how. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because it isn&rsquo;t hard to see that you&rsquo;re not
happy, and it makes me very sad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose people do notice it,&rdquo; said Louise.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;m not happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just what I thought. Well, can you tell me
the cause of it? Eric has succeeded in a good
many things, and I don&rsquo;t like to see him make a
failure of his marriage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You two ought to be happy. You have everything;
you married for love, presumably. I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ve done your part. It must be Eric&rsquo;s
fault in some way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise began pulling off her gloves, her chin
suddenly trembling like that of a child who is
about to cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fault, I suppose. We&rsquo;re simply
not suited to each other. Eric should have had a
wife who&rsquo;d be willing to sit at his feet all day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">37</a></span>
long, and tell him how wonderful he is. A sort
of echo.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure that would please him? And
suppose it did&mdash;after all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said with determination. &ldquo;There
are plenty of other people to tell him what fine
speeches he makes, and how clever he is. I&rsquo;m not
going to be one of them. He&rsquo;ll hear the truth
from his wife, whether he likes it or not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think he makes good speeches?&rdquo;
persisted Madame Claire gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say he does, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you said he would hear the truth
from you. If he does make a good speech, I
should think he&rsquo;d love to hear you say so. If you
do believe in him and in his ability, Louise, I wish
you would let him know it. I don&rsquo;t believe you
have any idea how much it would mean to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise got up and walked to the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have his ability and his cleverness thrown
at me by his admirers year in and year out,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick to death of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And are you the only one who never encourages
or praises him?&rdquo; asked Madame Claire. &ldquo;A
man must find that rather bitter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise turned from the window with an abrupt
movement.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">38</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish him to know that he can&rsquo;t have admiration
and flattery from every one. It will be
the ruination of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! I thought so. So it&rsquo;s really for his
good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&rdquo;Well, as I promised to be frank, no; I don&rsquo;t
suppose it is. But I can&rsquo;t help it. Things have
always been made too easy for him. Why should
he be such a darling of the gods? Life isn&rsquo;t easy
and pleasant for me. Why should it be for him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Madame Claire laughed suddenly.
&ldquo;Forgive me, Louise, but there&rsquo;s something rather
funny in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In your wanting to be a sort of hair shirt.
Oh, dear me, I don&rsquo;t know why I laughed. Only,
my dear, there&rsquo;s so very little happiness in the
world. I&rsquo;d forgotten there were good people
going about trampling on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better go away for a while,&rdquo; said
Louise finally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; urged Madame Claire. &ldquo;It would be
an excellent thing for both of you. Stay away
from Eric long enough to be glad to see him when
you get back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">39</a></span>
&ldquo;If I were,&rdquo; said Louise, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never give him
the satisfaction of knowing it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire called once more on the deity
who understands women.
</p>


<p>
&ldquo;And yet, Louise,&rdquo; she said, with all her courage,
&ldquo;you love him. You love Eric. I know you
do. Some day you may find out how much, and
it may be too late. That will be the tragedy.
You&rsquo;ll know that you had only to reach out your
hand&mdash;you&rsquo;re like a child, you know. Have you
ever seen a child while playing with other children,
receive some fancied slight, and withdraw,
hurt? I have. The other children don&rsquo;t even
know what the trouble is, and they go on with
their game. The hurt child stands apart, lonely
and miserable. They call her presently to come
and join them, and she longs to go, but can&rsquo;t&mdash;<em>can&rsquo;t</em>!
Something won&rsquo;t let her. Oh, I know, I
know! I must have been that child once. I know
what she feels. She stands there kicking at a
stone, longing, yes, longing to go out into the sunshine
again and play. She knows that game better
than they do. They even call to her to come
and lead them. But she can&rsquo;t. She sulks. She
doesn&rsquo;t want to sulk. She suffers. And then the
nurse comes, and the play is over, and she is taken
off to bed. It is too late. It is finished.&hellip;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040">40</a></span>
Louise! You stupid child! Isn&rsquo;t it something
like that? Tell me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire&rsquo;s finger had found the spot,
evidently. Louise&rsquo;s hardness, her bravado, suddenly
left her. Madame Claire had never seen
her cry before, and the sight seemed to her very
pitiful. Her tears made her seem younger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is like that.&rdquo; Her voice came muffled from
the handkerchief she was pressing to her face.
&rdquo;But I&rsquo;m helpless. I can&rsquo;t be different. I tell you
I can&rsquo;t. The more Eric tries to be nice to me, the
more I harden toward him. The more I want to
meet him half way, the less I&rsquo;m able to. I&rsquo;m not
hard, really; I long to be different. But it&rsquo;s too
late. It&rsquo;s grown on me now. I can&rsquo;t stop it. I
suppose I must go on like this forever. My life
is a misery to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
It was a prayer of thanksgiving that went up
to the god who understands women that night.
Madame Claire felt that now all things were possible.
Where there had been a blank wall, there
was now an open gate&mdash;for her, at least. How
long it would be before the gate would be open to
Eric, she dared not think.

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting epubmaker-bquote-hack3">
&ldquo;My Dear Stephen,
</p>
<div class="letter-body">

<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;I was delighted with your letter, I believe
you are feeling better, for you sounded far more
like your old self. Especially the postscript,
which I thought a most hopeful indication.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I remember old Jock Wetherby. Poor
old thing! How perfectly ghastly to approach
the end of one&rsquo;s life as a mere elderly libertine.
For I feel there is very little else one could truthfully
carve on his tombstone. And what a commentary
on free will! He once had gifts and
opportunities such as are given to few.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Last night I went with Judy and Noel to see
that enchanting sprite Karsavina. I shall never
forget it. As a rule one watches people dance,
but last night I danced too. I swear that my
spirit left its rheumatic old body and sprang and
whirled and darted in the midst of all that color
and movement with the music splashing and rippling
about it. For a few hours I bathed in the
Fountain of Youth&mdash;that fountain whose waters,
I believe, are made up of music, color, and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">42</a></span>
other ingredients that man with his slow mind has
not yet discovered. Certainly I was never less
conscious of flesh and bones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why is it, I ask myself, that only certain
combinations of sound and color can produce this
effect, or give this measure of delight? Suppose,
one day, some one were to hit upon the utmost
perfection in arrangement of sound, color and
form, would it open up a straight path like a shaft
of light for our spirits to glide upon into some
other world than this? For I feel we are very
near that other world when our senses are so
stirred and lifted up by beauty. I wonder! But
perhaps there is already perfect beauty in the
world, and it is only that our spirits lack the necessary
freedom from earthly things&mdash;or why should
we not drift into Paradise itself upon the perfume
of a rose?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the moment my mind is very full not of
Paradise but of Eric and Louise. She has decided
to go and stay with her people in Norfolk
for a while, where, I fear, she will continue to be
unhappy. Things had come to a dangerous pass
with them, and Eric is as sore and puzzled as a
man can be. Hers is a strange nature. I have
tried hard to find a chink in the armor of her bitterness.
Poor Louise! And yet I believe she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">43</a></span>
would go to the stake vowing she had been a good
wife to him. There are a great many women, I
find, who think that if they neither leave nor deceive
their husbands they are being good wives to
them. I pray that something&mdash;God knows what!&mdash;will
happen, to make a change of attitude easy
for her. She would have been happy, poor girl,
with a dull fellow to whom she could have condescended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I often say to myself, Stephen, that to realize
the imperfection of our relation to God, it is only
necessary to realize the imperfection of our relation
to one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have made a discovery of late. At least I
think it is a discovery. This is it. I believe that
while the majority of men are content to be merely
themselves, the majority of women are busy playing
some r&ocirc;le or other that takes their fancy or
that circumstances suggest. I think that most
women are forever conscious of an audience. I
shall never forget a girl I once knew&mdash;she would
be a very old woman now&mdash;who pretended to have
lost her lover in the Crimean War. I knew&mdash;for
she made me her confidante&mdash;that it was a quite
imaginary lover, and that she had invented him
to make people think her inconsolable, instead of
unsought, as was actually the case. So for years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">44</a></span>
she played the r&ocirc;le of a bereaved woman, and if
she is alive she is playing it yet. Every word,
every action was suited to the part, and eventually
she must of course have come to believe it herself.
When she talked to a girl about to be married or
in love, there was always a trembling smile upon
her lips, and the brightness in her eye (as the
novelists say) of unshed tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, my dear, treasure your happiness. I
pray you may be more fortunate than I was.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And youth knew her for a woman with a sad,
romantic story.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;A liar, pure and simple,&rsquo; you may say. Not
at all. Merely an actress playing her part.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take the case of Louise&mdash;a weak nature overshadowed
by a stronger one. What does she do?
Creates a r&ocirc;le for herself&mdash;the r&ocirc;le of a patient,
slighted woman, married to a selfish and exacting
man. Why? Seen under the microscope we
might discover it to be an attempt to attract
notice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take the case of my dear Judy. Most of her
friends are married. She, being very fastidious,
and finding that falling in love is at present quite
beyond her, creates a little r&ocirc;le for herself&mdash;the
r&ocirc;le of a very modern, independent girl who finds
that sort of love unnecessary to her happiness.
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">45</a></span>
&ldquo;Then there is Millicent. She too is playing
a part, though she would be horrified if I told her
so. Hers is to be as much as possible like her
surroundings, and to imitate as closely as she can
the other women of her set. She has become as
conventional and as harmlessly snobbish as they.
At heart she is a kindly creature, but since marrying
her John she has disguised herself so well as
a Pendleton that if I had not a good memory for
faces I would find it hard to distinguish her from
all the other Pendletons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then there was Connie&mdash;poor Connie!
Her r&ocirc;le was that of a woman of great emotions,
of devastating loves&mdash;a sort of Camille. But
underneath it I imagine and hope is still the simple,
credulous woman who looked for happiness
where happiness was not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And,&rsquo; perhaps you&rsquo;ll ask, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t men make
r&ocirc;les for themselves?&rsquo; Rarely; and when they
do they are insufferable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very tired and must stop. Tell me who
else is at Cannes.
</p>

</div>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;Accept my affectionate greetings,</p>
<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Claire.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="post-script">
&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;You tell me nothing of your life all
these years.&rdquo;

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">46</a></span>
Time never seemed to Madame Claire to pass
slowly, but it had never passed less slowly than
now. Stephen de Lisle&rsquo;s letters undoubtedly
added a spice of excitement and anticipation to
her days. She seldom went out (for she disliked
fog, and London seemed just then to have gone
to bed with a thick yellow blanket pulled over it)
and she only asked those people to come to see her
who, she said, touched her at the most points.
She hated polite boredoms, and unless her visitors
pleased or amused her, she preferred to be left
to her own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Of late her mind had run much upon her youngest
daughter Connie, the beauty of the family&mdash;Connie
who had &ldquo;thrown her bonnet over the
mill,&rdquo; as the saying was in those days, and run off
with Petrovitch, who was at that time first capturing
London and Paris with his marvelous
playing.
</p>

<p>
The blow had nearly broken her father, but
Madame Claire was made of sterner stuff, and
had long observed tendencies in her lovely daughter
which promised to lead to this very
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;nouement</span>.
Connie Gregory had one of those entirely
beautiful faces which seem so at variance with the
tragedies they evoke. She had the prettiest and
weakest mouth, and the most irresistible blue eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">47</a></span>
that ever gave delight to a painter of pretty
women. And she was &ldquo;done&rdquo; by all the fashionable
artists of the day in every imaginable style
of dress and posture. She had a very small share
of wit, but with women like Connie, a little wit
goes a long way. Her lovely head was forever
turning to look down dark paths, and no one but
her mother ever observed those sidelong glances.
When she was twenty-two, she married a perfectly
suitable young man, and Madame Claire
hoped that the then serious duties of wifehood
and motherhood would fill her shallow little head
to the exclusion of dark romancing. But they had
been married less than a year when Petrovitch
with his leonine head and his matchless playing
became the rage of London, and Connie, in company
with a good many other women of her type,
threw her youth and beauty, like a bouquet of
flowers, at his feet. He was able to resist much,
but the sheer loveliness of Connie made such an
onslaught upon his bored indifference&mdash;wherein
was mingled the most astonishing conceit&mdash;that
when his contracts in London expired, he returned
to Paris with the emotional and hysterical young
wife clinging to his arm.
</p>

<p>
It was just at the outbreak of the Boer War,
and Leonard Humphries, her husband, very naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">48</a></span>
seized the opportunity of getting himself
honorably shot. When that event took place, as
it did some months later, people thought that
Connie would at least legalize her irregular attachment
by marriage, but Petrovitch produced
a sturdy German wife, and scotched all such
hopes. So London saw the lovely Connie no
more.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire bore her trouble with all the
philosophy at her disposal. She never tried to
avoid the subject, and was quite as willing to talk
about Connie as about Eric or Millicent, in the
wise belief that wounds exposed to the air now
and then have the best chance of healing. For
years after she sent letters and often money to
Connie through her banker, for she knew well
enough where a lack of funds might lead those
uncertain steps. For a while her letters were answered,
but it was not long before the answers
ceased to come. She had heard nothing from
Connie for many years now, and she no longer
expected to hear. She thought of her as a foolish
and unhappy woman, whose punishment would be,
here or hereafter, self-inflicted, and understanding
human nature as she did, she refrained from
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
As for Eric, he was of the opinion that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">49</a></span>
world suffers less on the whole from women who
love not wisely but too well, than from women
who love too little. Weighed in the perhaps
faulty scales of a man&rsquo;s judgment, therefore,
Connie was a better woman than Louise. Connie
gave all and got nothing, while Louise took all
without a thank you, and gave nothing. But men
are always more inclined to forgive the generous
sins than the ungenerous.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">&ldquo;Old Stephen&rsquo;s&rdquo;</span>
letter in answer to Madame
Claire&rsquo;s second one, contained a great deal that
was of interest to her.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">&ldquo;Dear Claire,</p>

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t answer your last as promptly as I
wanted to because of the ills of the flesh. However,
I feel freer of them to-day than I have for
some time past. Your letters get better and better.
I wish I could write like you. I&rsquo;ve no gifts.
I thought once I had a gift for politics. Well,
perhaps I had, but I hadn&rsquo;t the gift of pleasing&mdash;for
long. I offended the Great Cham of my day,
and after that it was like going down a greased
slide. But better men than I have set their feet
upon it. I had my say, and I paid for it, and I&rsquo;d
say it again if the chance came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want me to tell you something of my life
all these years. Well, here is an outline for you.
After I left England I was in the United States
for five years. A country gloriously endowed by
nature, but somewhat spoilt by man. I like Americans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">51</a></span>
individually; I number several of them
among my few friends, but I&rsquo;m not sure I like
them as a race. They&rsquo;re not a race&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
trouble&mdash;but they will be some day. There&rsquo;s little
racial breeding at present. As for characteristics,
if you find them in the South, you lose them
again in the East or West. You know more or
less how an Englishman or a Frenchman&rsquo;s going
to act, because, exceptions excluded, they run
pretty true to form. But you can&rsquo;t guess how an
American&rsquo;s going to act until you know whether
he&rsquo;s Irish, German, British or Scandinavian
American. Which complicates matters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I was five years in South America&mdash;three
of them in Peru which I grew to love.
After that&mdash;let me see&mdash;two in Burmah, one in
Ceylon, and the last five in sunny spots in France
and Italy&mdash;a sad spectator of war. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed
my travels. I have, I hope, learned much. But
I can&rsquo;t write about it. I&rsquo;m no good at that. Can&rsquo;t
think how I used to write speeches once&mdash;and
deliver them. I suppose living alone all these
years has made me inarticulate. Miss McPherson&rsquo;s
afraid of me, I believe. Silly little thing.
That annoys me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ask me who else is in Cannes. I&rsquo;m not
sure I ought to tell you, but knowing you as I do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">52</a></span>
I think you&rsquo;d want to be told. Connie&rsquo;s here&mdash;with
a man of course&mdash;and stopping at this hotel.
Miss McPherson wheels me about in a chair on
my goodish days, and I came upon them suddenly
in the grounds this morning. Connie passed by
without speaking, but I&rsquo;m certain she knew me.
She looks the unhappiest woman on God&rsquo;s earth.
Later I sent Miss McPherson to make inquiries,
and it seems they call themselves Count and
Countess Chiozzi. They may be for all I know.
At any rate, he looks a dirty little cad. I&rsquo;ll try
to speak to her, for I think you would like me to.
I will leave this letter open for a day or two, in
case I do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spoke to her to-day in the garden. She was
alone. I said, &lsquo;Connie, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo;
She went a queer color, I thought, and said, &lsquo;Yes,
you&rsquo;re Mr. de Lisle.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;You knew me yesterday,&rsquo;
and she admitted it. I was in my bath-chair
(beastly thing!) and I sent Miss McPherson
away. Then I said, &lsquo;Well, Connie, I see
you&rsquo;re the Countess Chiozzi now. Are you in
Cannes for the winter?&rsquo; She said she supposed
she was; that Cannes did as well as another place.
She asked me if I&rsquo;d been in England lately, and
when I said, &lsquo;Not in twenty years,&rsquo; she exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">53</a></span>
&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know whether&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and stopped.
I knew what she wanted to ask, and said, &lsquo;Yes,
Connie, she&rsquo;s alive and well, thank God. I heard
from her only five days ago.&rsquo; She sat down on a
bench, and we talked for some time. She was
evidently wondering how much I knew, so I put
her at her ease by saying I knew all about it, and
I was afraid she was having a pretty rotten time.
She started to flare up at that, but thought better
of it, and said, &lsquo;I am. Chiozzi is a devil. I must
get away from him somehow. I&rsquo;m at the end of
my endurance.&rsquo; She went on to tell me about her
life, and the gist of it is this. I&rsquo;ll tell it in as few
words as possible. She has always loved Petrovitch,
she says, and no one else. He was in love
with her for a time, then tired of her, as she interfered
with his work. She wrote to her husband,
asking him to take her back, but before he
could reply a bullet took his life at Spion Kop.
A year or two later she met a French officer who
fell in love with her. They were to have been
married, but he found out about Petrovitch and
left her. Connie said bitterly that his life had
been what many men&rsquo;s lives are, but she wasn&rsquo;t
good enough. After that she went to Rome
where she met an American named Freeman. She
married him, and they sailed for New York on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">54</a></span>
the &lsquo;Titanic&rsquo;. He was drowned, but she reached
New York without so much as a wetting. She
tired of New York, returned to Paris, and there
met Chiozzi. They were married about four
years ago. She says he is evil incarnate; but then
women like Connie haven&rsquo;t much choice. I asked
her if I might tell you all this, and she said I
might, and also sent you her love, but said she
couldn&rsquo;t possibly write to you herself at present.
She still loves that poltroon Petrovitch, and would
go around the world to see him, I believe. She
ought to leave Chiozzi, that much is certain. I
can see she fears him as much as she hates him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a lot of people chuck away their lives
in learning that passion&rsquo;s a boglantern! The
thing that stands chiefly in the way of human
progress is the fact that we&rsquo;ve each got to find
things out for ourselves. Women found out what
Connie&rsquo;s finding out (I hope) two thousand years
ago. Does that help Connie forward? Not a
whit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t write more now.

<p>
The next day, Madame Claire read the letter
to Judy, who was keenly interested.
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">55</a></span>
&ldquo;Aunt Connie has always seemed rather a fabulous
creature&mdash;a sort of myth&mdash;to me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite realize her. Would you like me to
go to Cannes and fetch both her and &lsquo;Old Stephen&rsquo;
home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire thought not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd you should have had three children
so entirely different,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;They all
had exactly the same environment and the same
care. How on earth do you account for these
things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied her grandmother. &ldquo;I can
merely suppose that they all require different experiences;
and they&rsquo;re certainly getting them.&rdquo;
Her eyes rested on Judy in her brown dress and
furs, and on her face with its challenging dark
eyes and the too wide mouth that she loved. She
wondered what experiences would be hers. Not
Connie&rsquo;s; and even more surely, not Millicent&rsquo;s.
So far her life had been even and tranquil&mdash;too
tranquil for her own liking. She wanted to live.
She had a great deal to give to life&mdash;and so far
she had not lived at all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, like every one else,&rdquo; went on Madame
Claire, &ldquo;they are working out something&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what. After all, my children are
just people. So many mothers think of their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">56</a></span>
children as apart from the rest of the world. I
don&rsquo;t. Connie, Eric, Millicent&mdash;just people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eric isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; protested Judy. &ldquo;Eric is one of
the gods come to earth again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not Apollo!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never liked his profile.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not Apollo. A youngish sort of Jove, but
without his skittishness, or his thunders.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what you mean. There is something
simple and Greek about Eric. It&rsquo;s nice of you to
see it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity he&rsquo;s my uncle,&rdquo; remarked
Judy. &ldquo;Do you know, your daughter Millicent
has been extremely troublesome lately? I wish
you&rsquo;d speak to her about it. It isn&rsquo;t only the
marriage topic. She wants me to pattern myself
after the tiresome daughters of her most tiresome
friends. You know the sort of girls I mean.
They come out in droves each year, and play
tennis in droves, and get married in droves, and
have offspring in droves, and get buried beside
their forefathers in droves. It&rsquo;s so dull. I hate
doing things in droves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This amused Madame Claire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Individualists have rather a bad time of it in
your mother&rsquo;s particular set,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">57</a></span>
course even I want you to marry, because I think
you&rsquo;d be happier in the long run; but not until
you find some one you can&rsquo;t do without.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a sort of presentiment,&rdquo; Judy told her,
flushing, &ldquo;that if I ever do marry it will be some
one undesirable. That is,&rdquo; she hastened to explain,
&ldquo;undesirable from mother&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But not necessarily from mine?&rdquo; inquired
Madame Claire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; returned Judy.
</p>

<p>
She walked from the hotel to the house in
Eaton Square where the Pendletons had lived
ever since Noel was born, feeling that the world
was a very blank sort of place at the moment.
Having done vigorous war work for nearly five
years, she was missing it more than she knew.
Millicent could and did respond to the call of
patriotism, and had seen her sons go forth to war
like a Spartan mother; but why her only daughter
should continue to do work long after the coming
of peace, and when she had a comfortable home,
social duties and flowers to arrange, was more
than she could understand. So Judy, weary of
argument, stayed at home, paid calls and arranged
flowers. She felt something of an impostor,
too, telling herself that she had cost her
parents a great deal, and they were not getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">58</a></span>
their money&rsquo;s worth. She had been educated and
given an attractive polish for one purpose&mdash;to
attract and wed a suitable man of a like education
and polish. Being honest to the backbone she was
distressed about it. She had not fulfilled her side
of the contract, and her parents had, to the best
of their belief, more than fulfilled theirs.
</p>

<p>
She avoided the drawing-room where there was
tea and chatter, and hurried to her room, which
Noel called &ldquo;The Nunnery,&rdquo; because of its austere
simplicity. The white walls, quaint bits of
furniture, and stiff little bed suggested the sixteenth
century. The rest of the house was Millicent&rsquo;s
affair, and was &ldquo;done&rdquo; every few years in
the prevailing mode by a well-known firm of
decorators.
</p>

<p>
Noel wandered into her room soon after she
reached it, and while she took off her hat and
coat, he sat on the foot of the bed, which, if any
one else had done it, would have seriously annoyed
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Claire?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wonderful as ever. She&rsquo;s got more common
sense, Noel, than the rest of the family put together.
What do you think? She&rsquo;s heard about
Aunt Connie, through &lsquo;Old Stephen.&rsquo; He saw
her in Cannes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">59</a></span>
&ldquo;Connie?&rdquo; He whistled his astonishment.
&ldquo;The erring aunt! What&rsquo;s she doing in Cannes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She seems to have married some awful
bounder, fairly recently. A Count Somebody.
And she&rsquo;s fearfully unhappy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she come home? Afraid of public
opinion, and mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;can you wonder? She has no friends
left, I suppose. It must be pretty awful for her.
Of course you&rsquo;ll say she&rsquo;s made her own bed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary, I wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything
so trite. What do you take me for? I&rsquo;d
trot her round like anything if she came here.
It isn&rsquo;t everybody who&rsquo;s got a beautiful, notorious
aunt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather curious to see her,&rdquo; admitted
Judy. &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;d like her
particularly. She must be rather a fool to do
what she did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; Noel defended her. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re a certain type&mdash;well, you just are that type,
and you act accordingly. That&rsquo;s what she did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Noel,&rdquo; protested Judy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
useless, easy sort of philosophy. According to
that, no one can help anything they do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more they can, if they&rsquo;re the sort of people
who do that sort of thing. When they get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">60</a></span>
over being that sort of people they&rsquo;ll act differently,
but not before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hair-splitting sort of argument,&rdquo; said
Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any more than you can help being a spinster,&rdquo;
he explained, developing his theory. &ldquo;Being the
spinster type, you act accordingly. When you
pull yourself together and make up your mind to
be another type, you&rsquo;ll cease to be a spinster. But
not before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy sat down, facing him. It always amused
her to discuss herself with Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I the spinster type?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s fairly obvious. Look
at this room!&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a room
like this if I had ten husbands&mdash;or even lovers,
for that matter. You&rsquo;ll have to do better than
that. How else am I the spinster type, apart
from my room?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a spinster in your mind,&rdquo; he asserted.
&ldquo;You think celibately.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, now you&rsquo;re being too ridiculous!&rdquo; she
scoffed.
</p>

<p>
He crossed his long legs and lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear girl, you don&rsquo;t understand thought.
What you think, you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">61</a></span>
&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re a second Solomon,&rdquo; said his
sister, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I disagree. I
am entirely modern in my thoughts. I don&rsquo;t wish
to be anything else. I&rsquo;m not like Eric. Eric
thinks we have had the best. I think we are
always having the best. But to return to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do return to me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to cause
a digression. How can I stop being the spinster
type?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By not hemming yourself in so much. You
surround your femininity with barbed-wire entanglements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really? They don&rsquo;t seem to have kept Pat
Enderby out, and some others I could mention.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They never got in. That&rsquo;s what I complain
of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but my dear Noel&mdash;you surely don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;m going to turn myself into a sort of vampire
just to please you? Not that I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m
almost certain I could.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never meant that. You willfully misunderstand
me. Vampires are all very well on the
screen, or on some paving stone in Leicester
Square, but they don&rsquo;t go in our sort of life. No
man would willingly marry one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t on the screen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">62</a></span>
always marry the little thing with curls and the
baby smile. Is that what you&rsquo;d like me to be?
Because I honestly don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s my type
either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I find arguing with women very trying,&rdquo; observed
Noel. &ldquo;They always drag in unessentials,
and dangle them before your eyes as if they
were main issues. Even you do it. As for
mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind. Let&rsquo;s get back to the main issues.
I am the main issue&mdash;or my spinsterhood.
What do you want me to do, exactly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply this. I want you to cut the barbed-wire
entanglements and come out into the open
now and then. Men aren&rsquo;t wild animals, after
all. They&rsquo;re only human beings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy suddenly decided to drop nonsense.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know why I keep inside the barbed
wire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because any man that I meet in this house has
been asked here in the hope that I&rsquo;ll find him
marriageable. And so the fairest&mdash;the only decent
thing I can do is to let him know as soon as
possible that I&rsquo;m not in the market, so to speak.
If he&rsquo;s a fairly good sort and seems to find me
at all interesting, I&mdash;well, I put up more barbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">63</a></span>
wire. Of course I oughtn&rsquo;t to mind, but it&rsquo;s all
so obvious. I hate it. It was different with Pat.
I liked him, and besides, he was your friend &hellip;
but even then &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think girls do have a rotten time of it,&rdquo;
agreed Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made me self-conscious,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;This business of matrimony always in the air.
As it is, I wouldn&rsquo;t raise a finger to attract any
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not even the right one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Least of all the right one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel got up and stretched himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, old dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a prophecy.
When you meet the right man&mdash;hateful
phrase&mdash;you&rsquo;ll cut the entanglements, climb the
barricades, and give yourself up to the enemy.
That is, if I know anything of my sister Judy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t. But you&rsquo;re an old darling just the
same. Are you in or out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out. Dining at the club with Gordon. His
show! But I&rsquo;m coming home early. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Only I&rsquo;m dining with the Bennetts,
and they usually send me home in the Heavenly
Chariot, so I think I may as well pick you up
at the club.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">64</a></span>
&ldquo;Do. I&rsquo;ll amuse myself somehow till you
come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About ten-thirty or eleven,&rdquo; she told him.
&ldquo;And be on the look-out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right-o.&rdquo; He walked to the door and then
turned. &ldquo;And think over what I&rsquo;ve said, old
girl.&rdquo;
</p>


<div class="chapter">
  <p><a name="linkChapter06" id="linkChapter06"></a>

  <h2><a href="#linkTOC06" title="Link to the table of contents.">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
&ldquo;Heavenly Chariot&rdquo; was Judy&rsquo;s name for
the Bennetts&rsquo; shining gray car. The Pendletons
had one of their own, an elderly and dignified
Daimler, but for some reason unfathomable by
the younger members of the family, it was never
allowed out at night, when it was most wanted.
Millicent thought that Forbes, the old chauffeur
and ex-coachman, required his evenings to himself,
and as Forbes had never been known to object
to this arrangement, it stood, and the family
relied on taxis, or the underground.
</p>

<p>
So that Judy was feeling uncommonly luxurious
close on eleven that night, when the beautiful
gray nose of the Heavenly Chariot thrust its way
through the fog that had shut London from the
sky for three days past. She loved the movement,
the mystery of the dark streets, the soft
menace of the fog.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the very essence of London,&rdquo; she
thought.
</p>

<p>
They turned into Pall Mall, and she was sorry
to think that the perfect motion would cease in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">66</a></span>
a moment. What happened next, happened with
such amazing suddenness that in three seconds it
became a problem already to be reckoned with, a
situation to be met as best one could.
</p>

<p>
They had knocked some one down in the fog.
An instant before she had been reveling in that
smooth slipping along&mdash;almost the annihilation
of friction&mdash;and now, between the ticks of a clock,
some one, because of this inconsequential little
journey of theirs, was robbed of health perhaps,
or life. While her mind was struggling to accept
a fact so hateful, her feet had taken her to the
front of the car almost before the chauffeur had
brought it to a standstill. Their victim had clung
to that long gray nose&mdash;clung for an instant and
then gone down. Another man was bending over
him, drawing him gently into the pool of radiance
their lights made.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chip!&rdquo; the other man was saying. &ldquo;Chip, old
man, are you badly hurt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no answer. Judy put her arm under
the limp man&rsquo;s shoulder, and they raised him up.
He stood swaying between them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take him to the car,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
A constable (who seemed nebulous all but his
buttons, which the light caught) loomed up out
of the blackness, and demanded names and addresses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">67</a></span>
Mills, the chauffeur, seemed unable to
cope with the disaster, which he considered had
come upon them ready-made, out of the night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was my friend&rsquo;s fault entirely,&rdquo; said the
other man. &ldquo;He started to cross without looking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too careful a night like this,&rdquo; remarked
the constable, making entries in his notebook.
</p>

<p>
The victim suddenly straightened himself and
said in a thick voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly all right.&rdquo;
Then he became limp again.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that Noel arrived, having
been keeping a look-out, as instructed by Judy.
The wail of metal-studded tires being brought to
a sudden stop had attracted his notice, and he
came out to see what was up. The constable,
observing his empty sleeve, addressed him as
Captain, and things began to progress. Like
many another policeman who has to do with street
crossings, this one considered women biological
absurdities. Mills and the victim&rsquo;s friend got
&ldquo;Chip&rdquo; into the car and made him as comfortable
as possible. Noel sat outside with Mills, and
Judy sat beside the injured man, overcoming an
almost uncontrollable impulse to draw that bending
head down to her shoulder.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">68</a></span>
For the belief had come to her, at the moment
when she saw Chip&rsquo;s white face in the glare from
their lamps, that they had chosen the nicest man
in all London to knock down.
</p>

<p>
His friend, who sat sideways in one of the small
seats, introduced himself as Major Stroud, and
the victim, on whom he kept an anxious eye, as
Major Crosby.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right as soon as we get him home
and to bed,&rdquo; he assured Judy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, but
you&rsquo;re not in any way to blame. Saw the whole
thing, so I know. Crosby&rsquo;s always walking into
things. He&rsquo;s everlastingly thinking about that
book of his. I tried to grab his arm, but it was
too late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How badly do you think he&rsquo;s hurt?&rdquo; She
could hear the injured man&rsquo;s laborious breathing,
and was heartsick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, just a knock on the head, I expect, against
that curb. Thank Heaven it was no worse. Your
chauffeur did splendidly. Can&rsquo;t think how he
avoided running over him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But a knock on the head may mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you worry about it, Miss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pendleton,&rdquo; Judy said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Pendleton. I&rsquo;ll ring up the doctor as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069">69</a></span>
soon as we get to his rooms. He&rsquo;s pretty tough&mdash;aren&rsquo;t
you, Chip old man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put an affectionate hand on his friend&rsquo;s
knee. At that moment Chip swayed suddenly
toward Judy&rsquo;s fur-wrapped shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better let me sit there, Miss Pendleton,&rdquo; suggested
Major Stroud. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no light weight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;I was a
<dfn title="Voluntary Aid Detachment">V.A.D.</dfn>
for years.&rdquo; She slipped her hand down to his
wrist and felt his pulse. &ldquo;Why do you say he&rsquo;s
always thinking about his book? What book?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Chip&rsquo;s a writer, you see. He&rsquo;s always
writing something. Just now it&rsquo;s a book on religions.
Queer hobby for a fighting chap, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The car sang its way up Campden Hill while
Judy listened to what Major Stroud had to say
about his friend. He was evidently devoted to
him. When they stopped at last, purring softly
before a narrow house in a narrow turning off
Church Street, she felt she knew more about the
two of them than she did about many people she
had known far longer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make short work of things now,&rdquo; said the
Major in his brisk way as he got out. &ldquo;Come
along, Chip old man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Very gently he and Mills lifted him out, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">70</a></span>
carried him into the house and up three flights of
excessively dark and narrow stairs, while Judy
and Noel followed behind. They had to pause
once or twice as the weight and length of their
burden made getting round corners very difficult.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wait till the doctor comes,&rdquo; said
Noel. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go home in the car
now, Judy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I
wait too? I dare say I can help. Noel, isn&rsquo;t
it ghastly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like Chip,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny, but I
did the moment I saw him. Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy nodded, unable to say much. Her throat
ached, and she knew she was not very far from
tears. It was so grotesque and unreal, that they
should have caused this unnecessary suffering.
</p>

<p>
Major Stroud telephoned to the doctor, and
Mills went to fetch him, as being the quickest
way. Meanwhile Noel and the Major got Chip
into bed.
</p>

<p>
Judy, left to herself, explored the little flat.
She lit a gas-ring in the tiny kitchenette and put
a kettle on. Then she found a small store of
brandy which she brought out in case it was
wanted. As she busied herself getting ready
things the doctor might ask for she made herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">71</a></span>
well acquainted with Chip&rsquo;s home. The sitting
room possessed two solidly comfortable chairs
and a sofa, all covered in brown linen. There was
a gate-legged table, two etchings by Rops, and a
vast number of books on religious subjects. Except
for the books and the etchings it was as
impersonal a room as a man could have. It
touched her, it was so&mdash;she searched for a word&mdash;so
starved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Man cannot live by books alone, my poor
Chip,&rdquo; she thought. She seemed to see again the
kindly, tired lines about his mouth and eyes. She
imagined a lonely life for him, with Major Stroud
as the only close human tie. They had been
through two campaigns together, the latter had
told her. Fancy calling the Great War a campaign!
She smiled at the thought. A hard-bitten
man, the Major. She supposed the two
were about of an age&mdash;say, forty-three. Bachelors?
Oh, undoubtedly.
</p>

<p>
Then the doctor arrived&mdash;a cheerful, bustling
man with a short gray beard. He seemed to have
known the two of them for years.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I helped to bring this young man into the
world,&rdquo; he told Judy, clapping an affectionate
hand on the Major&rsquo;s solid shoulder. That gentleman,
who didn&rsquo;t look as though he could possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">72</a></span>
have needed help on that or any other
occasion, smiled a little sheepishly, and then the
bedroom door closed upon them. Noel and Judy,
left in unhappy suspense in the sitting room looked
at one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you have knocked down some
drunken rotter?&rdquo; asked Noel, walking about the
room with his hand in his pocket. &ldquo;Why pick
out Chip?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Strange how the name had made itself at home
with both of them!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? Oh, Noel, I can&rsquo;t bear it to be true!
Haven&rsquo;t we dreamt it all? If anything happens
to him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If only there are no beastly consequences,&rdquo;
said Noel, frowning, &rdquo;you may have done everybody
a good turn in the end. I mean&mdash;he seems
such a decent sort&mdash;I like him. And I think he
might like us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s concussion, Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be only very slight. Well, we&rsquo;ll know
in a few minutes. There was a terrible bump on
his forehead, but we couldn&rsquo;t find any other
marks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose we&rsquo;d killed him!&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t like
Judy to suppose ghastly possibilities. &ldquo;If I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">73</a></span>
hadn&rsquo;t gone to the club to pick you up,&rdquo; she
mused, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d gone straight home, it wouldn&rsquo;t
have happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, hush, Judy! What&rsquo;s the good of all
that? Look here&rdquo;&mdash;he paused in front of her&mdash;&ldquo;Chip
evidently isn&rsquo;t well off. I intend to arrange
with the doctor, about bills. So you back me
up, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;d thought of that too. And
Noel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep this to ourselves. I&rsquo;d much rather
not tell the family anything about it. Wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much. It&rsquo;s our affair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hardly spent any of my allowance lately.
We&rsquo;ll go halves about the bills.&hellip; Don&rsquo;t even
tell Gordon, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gordon? He&rsquo;s about the last person I&rsquo;d tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here the doctor returned, followed by Major
Stroud. They closed the bedroom door softly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing to worry about,&rdquo; the doctor told
them cheerfully, in that hearty voice common to
the medical profession. &ldquo;A man might come
off worse in the hunting field any day, and no
one make a fuss about it. Slight concussion and
bruises, and that&rsquo;s all, young lady.&rdquo;
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">74</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s quite enough,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I hate
concussions. And there really are no bones
broken? You&rsquo;re not trying to spare our feelings?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Word of honor as a father of seven. You
can come and see your victim with your own eyes
in a day or two. Major Stroud will spend the
night here on the sofa, and the nurse will be on
hand in the morning, if she&rsquo;s wanted. So now,
Miss Juggernaut, you may roll home with a peaceful
mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cheered us up a lot, sir,&rdquo; said Noel,
shaking hands with him.
</p>

<p>
Major Stroud took them to the door, after
writing down their telephone number on a pad
that the methodical Chip had hanging over his
desk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell him, when he comes to, how sorry
we are, and how &hellip; how anxious?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the Major shook his head at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that to you,&rdquo; he said as they parted.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get the devil of a talking to from me&mdash;careless
beggar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They gave the news to the waiting Mills, and
drove home with little talk. When Judy reached
the door of her room, she kissed Noel good
night.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">75</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we decided not to tell any one,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;Mother would look him up in
<cite>Who&rsquo;s Who</cite>. It would be horrible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about Claire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we can tell her, of course.&rdquo;
</p>


<div class="chapter">

  <h2><a href="#linkTOC07" title="Link to the table of contents.">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Madame Claire</span>
was glad she was not included
in the ban of silence. She was much interested
in the affair. She was also&mdash;though she took
care not to let Judy see it&mdash;a little excited. It
was not, she felt, one of those incidents that seem
to have no consequences, nor leave any mark.
Something new, she believed, had been set in
motion, and that something new meant to poke a
disturbing finger into Judy&rsquo;s life. But she forbore
to ask too many questions.
</p>

<p>
She heard about it the next day, and Judy
told her that Noel had already talked to Major
Stroud over the telephone, and had learned that
Major Crosby was still unconscious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He told Noel we were not to worry&mdash;the
doctor&rsquo;s orders I believe&mdash;and then he went on
to say that he&rsquo;d once been unconscious for twenty-eight
hours himself, and had come to at the end
of it as lively as a cricket. But then he&rsquo;s a hopeless
optimist, and you never can believe optimists.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You and Noel seem to have taken him to
your hearts from the first,&rdquo; commented Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">77</a></span>
Claire. &ldquo;Chip, I mean. Well, I&rsquo;d back your
judgments against anybody&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you would have felt like that too.
But he isn&rsquo;t going to be easy to know,&rdquo; said her
granddaughter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he? Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very shy,&rdquo; answered Judy. &ldquo;He had
the shyest rooms I ever saw. Not a photograph
to be seen, nor an ornament, nor even a novel.
You know, you can guess at such a lot if there
are things like that about to help you. No, there
wasn&rsquo;t a single clue. But the greatest clue, in a
way, was the lack of clues. As though, because
of his shyness, he had tried to cover up his tracks.
I don&rsquo;t think he wants to be known.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he had to be knocked down by a motor,&rdquo;
said Madame Claire, &ldquo;I consider it a fortunate
thing that you were in it. After all, it might have
been any Tom or Dick&mdash;or Miss Tom or Dick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only wish he might take that view of it,&rdquo;
answered Judy. &ldquo;What news of Louise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire hoped to hear more about
Chip, but she was always quick to feel when a
change of subject was wanted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with her people in Norfolk. She wrote
Eric that she was enjoying the change, but that
she felt it was her duty to come back at the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">78</a></span>
of the week. Of course Eric wrote to her that
she wasn&rsquo;t to think of him, but that she must
stay as long as she felt inclined.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How that must have annoyed her! For what
she wanted was to come home as a martyr before
she was ready. What a woman! Don&rsquo;t you
think it a miracle that Eric doesn&rsquo;t fall in love
with some one else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I doubt if he ever will. He finds consolation
in his friends, and in his books, and in his work
of course. Eric isn&rsquo;t a man who falls in love
easily. And besides, I can&rsquo;t help thinking that
he still has hopes of Louise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think he still loves her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louise is his wife,&rdquo; answered Madame Claire,
&ldquo;and I believe that it hurts Eric intolerably to
feel that the one person in the world who should
be nearest to him, and who should understand him
the best, deliberately keeps aloof. He feels he
has failed&mdash;and Eric hates failure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he has failed, it isn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; said Judy.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for lack of trying. If he&rsquo;d been just a
nonentity she&rsquo;d have enjoyed condescending to
him. As long as he is what he is&mdash;sought-after
and charming&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be what she is&mdash;jealous and
bitter. I don&rsquo;t see how he stands it.&rdquo;
</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">79</a></span>
&ldquo;Like Eric,&rdquo; Madame Claire said gently, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help hoping.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A day or two later, Judy found her reading a
letter from Old Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal about Connie,&rdquo; she told
her. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it odd the way she seems to be coming
into our lives again? Here&rsquo;s what he says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And now a few words about Connie and her
Count. I&rsquo;ve talked to him several times, and
he&rsquo;s like some poisonous thing in a stagnant pond.
I do wish you could persuade her to leave him,
for he insults and humiliates her at every turn.
She confessed to me yesterday what I already
suspected&mdash;that he had gambled away most of
his money and much of hers at Monte Carlo, and
that he is constantly demanding more. I think
it would be advisable for Eric to come here if
he possibly can. She is frightened, and her nerves
are on edge. I suppose he threatens her, poor
woman. What do you think ought to be done?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;He stopped there,&rdquo; said Madame Claire,
&ldquo;and finished the letter next day. I&rsquo;ll read you
the rest.
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I was interrupted yesterday by Miss McPherson,
who wouldn&rsquo;t let me write more. So I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">80</a></span>
left the letter open, and I&rsquo;m glad I did, for there&rsquo;s
a sequel. Connie left here this morning for Paris,
without a word to anybody. I thought she would
have written me a letter to say good-bye, but she
hasn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know what brought matters to
this head, but I suspect it had something to do
with Mademoiselle Pauline, the dancer, with
whom the Count has been spending much of his
time, and more, I imagine, of his money. Miss
McPherson, who has her human side, has taken
a considerable interest in Connie&rsquo;s affairs, and
tells me she is sure there was a scene of some
sort last night. However that may be, Connie
has gone. They told me at the office that she
went to Paris, but left no forwarding address.
Well, my dear Claire, I fear all this will distress
you, but you have a brave heart, and would wish
to know. If you have any idea where Connie
would be likely to have gone, to what friends or
to what hotel, I cannot help thinking it would
be wise to send Eric to look for her. I say this
because she seemed to me a desperately unhappy
woman.&rsquo;
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all about that,&rdquo; said Madame Claire,
putting the letter away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think ought to be done?&rdquo; Judy
asked her.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">81</a></span>
&ldquo;Eric is coming here to-night, and I&rsquo;ll talk it
over with him. If he can spare the time to go
to Paris, I think it would be a good thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if he doesn&rsquo;t know where she is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I can guess,&rdquo; answered her grandmother.
&ldquo;Years ago, before the children were
grown up, we used to go and stay at a little
private hotel off the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avenue de la Grande Arm&eacute;e</span>.
In the autumn I recommended it to a friend of
your mother&rsquo;s, and she was delighted with it.
Judging from her description, I don&rsquo;t think it
can have changed much. She told me that the
granddaughter of the old Madame Perit&ocirc;t remembered
me perfectly and said that Connie,
whom she described as &lsquo;la belle Madame,&rsquo; often
went there when she wished to be quiet. I feel
sure she would wish to be quiet now, and I believe
that if Eric goes there he will find her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you want him to bring her to London?&rdquo;
inquired Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I had better leave that to him,&rdquo;
answered Madame Claire.
</p>


<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>


<p>
Eric went to Paris the day following. He had
no idea, when he left, whether he would try to
persuade Connie to come back to London or not.
He would decide that when he had seen her. Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">82</a></span>
did he explain matters to Louise, to whom the
very name of his once beautiful sister was anathema.
He sent her a wire, however, which said
merely, &ldquo;Called out of town for few days. Probably
back Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had been working very hard, and welcomed
a change of scene. He had not been out of England
since serving with his regiment in France,
and later in Italy, from which campaign he was
invalided home shortly before the Armistice. He
was now member for a London borough, having
given up soldiering for politics. His rather disconcerting
honesty and policy of no compromise
won him more friends in the former calling than
in the latter, and though he had enthusiastic
friends he had equally whole-hearted enemies,
among whom he began to fear he must number
his wife.
</p>

<p>
The thought of a lifelong companionship with
a woman who disliked, or seemed to dislike his
every attribute, appalled him. He had a way
of reducing problems to their simplest form, and
being a clear thinker, saw facts in all their nakedness.
Louise was his wife. He had tried to make
her happy. She either liked him or she did not.
If she did not like him, why live with him? And
if she did like him, why not show that she did?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">83</a></span>
It came to that. Other women liked him. Why
could not his wife? He had never tried to please
any other woman as he had tried to please her.
The thing was an enigma. They could have had
such delightful times together, for they had everything&mdash;health,
youth, money, friends. Her coldness
was inexplicable. She was not only cold to
him, but to all men, and to most women. If she
had cared for any one else he would have found a
way to release her. He tried to put it out of his
mind on the journey to Paris, and thought instead
of Connie. He had been so proud of her beauty
in the old days. He remembered her at dances,
surrounded by respectfully admiring young men.
How she had queened it for a while! And then&mdash;Petrovitch!
</p>

<p>
From Calais he shared a compartment with a
rather charming woman with whom he fell easily
into talk. He had a gift of nonsense which, when
he cared to use it, most people&mdash;his wife of
course excepted&mdash;found irresistible. So they
sparred pleasantly till the train neared Paris. But
in the end she struck a too personal note, talking
about herself and her affairs with an astonishing
lack of reserve, whereupon he liked her less.
When they separated she gave him her address,
but he forgot both it and her. She never forgot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">84</a></span>
him. If he had liked her more they would have
parted friends, or on the way to friendship, which
would have annoyed Louise, who only made
friends with people she had known or known of
for years. But her candor was without simplicity,
and her impulsiveness not without calculation, so
she passed out of his life, for he was fastidious
about women.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Eric</span>
drove at once to the little hotel off the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avenue de la Grande
Arm&eacute;e</span>, and made himself
known. He had wired for a room at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crillon</span>,
preferring not to stay too near Connie lest he
should find her surrounded by sympathetic friends.
He dreaded her friends.
</p>

<p>
The granddaughter of old Madame Perit&ocirc;t, a
pleasant-faced woman named Le Blanc, gave him
a cordial welcome, asked immediately after Madame
Claire and then told him in answer to his
question that Madame la Comtesse was resting,
but would undoubtedly see her brother. Who
indeed, she thought, would not be glad to see such
a brother&mdash;a brother with such delightful manners,
whose blue eyes&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ciel</span>!
Madame Le Blanc
was enchanted by the blueness of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Eric waited in the little salon, remembering
incidents of their extremely happy childhood.
Madame Claire had so often brought the three
of them there, during vacations. They had nearly
always come to Paris en route for the coast of
Brittany or Normandy when the Roman summers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">86</a></span>
became unbearable. He remembered how he and
Connie, an exquisite, long-legged child of fifteen,
had knocked over and broken a Dresden group
during a scrimmage. They had secretly substituted
for it another almost exactly like the first,
except that the dress of the shepherdess which
had been blue with pink flowers, was now pink
with blue flowers. There it stood, just where
their guilty hands had placed it, so many years
ago, and he could not resist taking it off the
mantelpiece and examining it. It was one of old
Madame Perit&ocirc;t&rsquo;s most prized possessions, and
how they laughed when they realized that she
had never noticed the difference! It might easily
have met the fate just then of its unlucky predecessor,
for he nearly dropped it, so suddenly and
quietly did Connie enter&mdash;and such a Connie!
</p>

<p>
It was characteristic of Eric that he never said
anything suitable to occasions. He kissed her
cheek, and then said, holding her at arm&rsquo;s length
and looking at her:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must come and dine with me. What do
you say to a sole and a broiled chicken somewhere?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Connie felt that something more was due
to the situation, so she clung to his arm and found&mdash;or
seemed to find&mdash;speech difficult.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">87</a></span>
&ldquo;Eric! Is it really you? My God! After
all these years! Oh, Eric!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nearly twenty, isn&rsquo;t it? And thirty or more
since we broke the Dresden group there. Go
and put your hat on. What a pretty dress!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; She turned about with something
of her old grace and coquetry. &ldquo;You were
always quick to notice nice things. But how did
you know where to find me, and why did you
come? This seems like a dream to me. And
you&rsquo;re still so good-looking!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, my dear. No one has ever told
me that. It is charming of you. I came to see
you. Mother guessed you would be here. And
now go and put on your hat, for I&rsquo;m very
hungry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a moment. I want to look at you.&hellip;
I&rsquo;d almost forgotten I had a brother. But how
did you know I was in Paris at all? That meddlesome
old Stephen de Lisle, I suppose, bless him!&rdquo;
Then her beautiful voice deepened. &ldquo;Eric, I&rsquo;ve
got very old, haven&rsquo;t I? Tell me the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eric told it in his own way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I never think about age,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;so it&rsquo;s no good asking me. I think you look
worried. Come, we&rsquo;ll dine early. There&rsquo;s a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">88</a></span>
great deal to talk about. And don&rsquo;t change. I
like you in that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo; She went to the door and
then turned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being taken out to dinner by
my own brother,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You make
me feel quite&mdash;respectable, Eric.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her last words hurt him. If there had been
any one with him he would have said as she left
the room:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God! The pity of it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It wasn&rsquo;t age he meant. He cared as little for
that as most intelligent men. Connie had lost
her youth. That was to be expected. But she
had never gained its far more interesting successor,
character. It was that he missed. She
was spiritually, mentally and morally down at the
heel. Her face was a weary mask, her yellow
hair had known the uses of peroxide as well as
of adversity, and her blue eyes, paler than her
brother&rsquo;s, looked out, without expression, from a
rim of carelessly darkened lashes. The frank
vulgarity of her scarlet lips revolted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All that,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;to win a&mdash;Chiozzi!&rdquo;
He had hurried her off to get her hat
because he couldn&rsquo;t bear to talk to her in that
room of childish memories. It brought back to
him too clearly the girl of fifteen, with her exquisite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">89</a></span>
sparkling face, her laughter, and that mane
of fine golden hair that people in the streets too
often turned to stare at.&hellip; He meant to help
her, he had come to help her&mdash;but how to go
about it? That he must leave to the inspiration
of the moment.
</p>

<p>
When she returned, handsomely furred and too
youthfully hatted, he gave her another kindly
kiss to encourage her&mdash;for he could see that she
was really moved&mdash;and took her arm as they went
to the door. An old woman in another salon
across the hall had observed their movements
with the keenest interest. She carried an ear
trumpet, but thanked Heaven that her eyes were
as good as ever. Good enough to distinguish the
paint on that woman&rsquo;s cheeks&mdash;which had not
prevented Mr. Gregory from kissing her. Lady
Gregory&rsquo;s only son! She knew he had married
the youngest daughter of old Admiral Broughton,
a great friend of the late King&rsquo;s. He had
once been heard to say to him at a garden party&mdash;it
must have been in 1907&mdash;There, they are
getting into a cab together. He has taken her
hand&mdash;off they go! Dear, dear! How very distressing!
Poor Lady Gregory, and poor neglected
wife! It wasn&rsquo;t as if she hadn&rsquo;t seen it with her
own eyes. And she hadn&rsquo;t lived in this wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">90</a></span>
old world for sixty-nine years&mdash;even though most
of them had been spent in Kensington&mdash;without
knowing a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaine</i>
when she saw one.
Odd she was to see Miss Thomkinson, a cousin
of the Broughtons, the very next day. No,
shocked as she was at the presence of such a
woman in that house, she preferred not to speak to
Madame le Blanc about it. It didn&rsquo;t go to enter
into arguments with these French people, and besides,
her vocabulary wasn&rsquo;t equal to it.
</p>

<p>
In the cab, Eric said gently:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Connie, my dear, I&rsquo;ve come to help you
in any way that I can, and to take you back to
England with me if you wish to go. I gather
that your marriage is anything but happy. Tell
me about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie tried to speak but her efforts ended in
a sudden burst of tears. She sobbed openly and
unbecomingly. Eric, his eyes full of pain and
concern, held her hand and looked out of the window
at the once familiar streets. She had lived
on her emotions for so long that self-control,
he supposed, was utterly beyond her now. It was
true that she had cried whenever she had felt
inclined, during the whole of her unhappy, stormy
life. But she usually cried for a purpose. This
was different. Something, probably the amazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">91</a></span>
matter-of-factness of her brother, had touched
the springs of her self-pity. At one step he had
spanned all that had happened in the last twenty
years. He was so entirely unchanged, while she&mdash;his
eyes were as clear as ever, his fitness obvious
at a glance, and his face scarcely lined. He represented
all that she had lost, all that was sane and
clean and wholesome. He reminded her of childish
cricket, and nursery teas, and days on the
river, and May Week, and clean young men in
flannels. She had not met a man of his type since
she had left her husband. She loved the faint
scent of lavender that lingered in the fresh folds
of the handkerchief he presently offered her. She
wondered if it would be possible for her to go
back with him, into the well-ordered life that he
and his kind led, away from the shoddy women
who had been her companions for years and the
men who were rotten to the core.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has been a shock to you,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;I
should have warned you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head. It wasn&rsquo;t that. What it
was she didn&rsquo;t feel capable of telling him now.
</p>

<p>
She wiped her eyes and cheeks recklessly with
his handkerchief. Her make-up was ruined, and
for the moment she didn&rsquo;t care, but presently at
the sight of the well-filled restaurant she pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">92</a></span>
herself together, and while Eric ordered dinner
she busied herself repairing her haggard mask.
No matter how badly Connie was looking, people
always observed that she was a woman who had
once been very beautiful. She joined him at the
table in a few minutes, looking as though tears
were as foreign to her nature as to a statue&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
It is characteristic of Connie&rsquo;s sort that they
forget they have made a scene two minutes after
it is over, and imagine that others forget as easily.
She glanced about the crowded room as she sat
down, hoping that she might be seen in the company
of such a man. She was proud of him, and,
to do her justice, proud of the fact that they were
brother and sister, forgetting that in twenty years
a resemblance that had once been remarkable had
nearly vanished.
</p>

<p>
Before dinner was over, she had given him an
outline of her life down to the present with commendable
honesty. She had no wish, apparently,
to gild the ugly sordidness of some of it, though
she made it appear that her misfortunes had
come to her more through the faithlessness and
selfishness of men than through her own weakness.
And yet men, it was obvious, were still her
chief interest in life. As she talked to Eric her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">93</a></span>
glance often wandered, and she made much play
with her still beautiful hands.
</p>

<p>
Her dread of Chiozzi and his treatment of her
seemed to Eric the most important part of her
story. It was that he had to deal with now. She
said he had threatened her life more than once in
order to extort money from her. Her income
had dwindled to barely seven hundred a year, all
that remained of the considerable fortune left her
by Morton Freeman. That much she had managed
to keep intact, in spite of the efforts of her
greedy Count.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I go back to him,&rdquo; she said with a shudder,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eric dreaded the idea of a divorce. Her affairs
had already had so much unsavory publicity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must not think of going back to him at
present,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Later we will see what
can be done. You can write to him from London,
if you wish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dread London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be safest there. And you will find
that people have forgotten. You must try to
begin again, my dear, and be content with contentment,
and simple things. You will not find
life exciting, but you may find it pleasant. I will
do what I can, and you will have mother, who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">94</a></span>
a marvel of marvels. I would suggest a little
house in the country, or a small flat in town.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She considered this, smoking a faintly perfumed
cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are Millicent&rsquo;s children like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re delightful. You&rsquo;ll love Judy and
Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Millie won&rsquo;t let them know me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I doubt if Millie will have very much to say
in the matter. If they choose to know you, they
will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your wife&mdash;Louise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may find her difficult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How difficult? One of those &hellip; those
good women, I suppose.&rdquo; This with a sneer that
made Eric wince.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louise is very &hellip; indifferent. Frankly, she
doesn&rsquo;t care a straw for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not care for you? She must be a fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He inclined his head in the slightest of bows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are my sister, and prejudiced.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know a man when I see one, whether he&rsquo;s
my brother or not.&rdquo; She gave a short laugh.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&ldquo;Mon Dieu!</span>
I ought to, by this time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; said Eric, &ldquo;considers me a tiresome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">95</a></span>
and conceited fellow. She dislikes a great many
things about me; no doubt with reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jealous,&rdquo; commented his sister, who could see
through other women.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So some of my friends say. I cannot understand
it. But you needn&rsquo;t see much of each
other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I know her sort,&rdquo; said Connie, watching
the smoke from her cigarette. &ldquo;Well, we both
seem to have made a mess of things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This struck Eric as humorous, but not a sign
of his amusement appeared in his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is Petrovitch now?&rdquo; he asked her.
</p>

<p>
She smiled to a passing acquaintance before she
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In America, I believe. Still lionized and applauded.
It seems to me, Eric, that men have
nine lives to a woman&rsquo;s one. Look at me &hellip;
a worn-out wreck, while he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bad fellow, Connie,&rdquo; said Eric; at which
she bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you say that. I love him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
Eric looked at her as though he would like to
see into her mind.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">96</a></span>
&ldquo;Tell me this. I ask you as I might ask any
woman in your place. Has it been worth it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes fell, and she seemed to be groping
for words. Then she rose from the table, gathering
up her long gloves and beaded bag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would tell you, if I knew,&rdquo; she said at last.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose I have lost all
sense of values.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is answer enough,&rdquo; he replied.
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>


<p>
As they drove back to the hotel she turned to
him and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When do you want me to be ready?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought to go back to-morrow,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;Would that be possible for you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then, a little dramatically, &ldquo;I place
myself in your hands, Eric. Do with me what
you will.&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">It</span>
was just a week after the accident that Judy
and Noel went to Campden Hill to see Major
Crosby. A message had come at last from Dr.
Ferguson to the effect that if Miss Juggernaut
and her brother cared to see their victim, they
might do so between three and five that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Major Stroud had rung them up almost daily,
and Noel had found it difficult to account to the
family for the sudden interest taken in him by
some one they had never heard of before. For it
was a household in which reticence was frowned
upon and discouraged. Only Gordon, being the
eldest son, was permitted to go and come without
explanations. He was naturally secretive, and on
the few occasions when he was pleased to give an
account of his doings, his mother listened to him
with something very like reverence. So Major
Stroud became &ldquo;a fellow at my club,&rdquo; which, as
it chanced, he was, and Millicent gave up the
attempt to penetrate further.
</p>

<p>
Judy had never felt as shy as on that Wednesday
afternoon in the middle of January. She and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">98</a></span>
Noel rode up Campden Hill on a bus, and walked
briskly, for it was a bitter day, from Church
Street to Chip&rsquo;s rooms.
</p>

<p>
On the way up the stairs she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me to do all the talking, Noel.
I feel idiotically nervous. I don&rsquo;t know what to
talk about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chuck maidenly modesty to the winds for
once,&rdquo; he advised, &ldquo;and talk about the weather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very helpful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when you&rsquo;ve done with the weather,
there&rsquo;s always the climate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I mean is, why not just be natural? I
expect he&rsquo;s safely unmarriageable, from the
money point of view. So you can let the barbed
wire alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; she said thankfully, &ldquo;Major Stroud
will be there, and he&rsquo;s always noisy and cheerful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was there, and at their knock admitted
them, looking very large and out of place in the
narrow hall. He was one of those men who
seem to belong astride a high, bony horse, or in
the solid armchair of a spacious London club.
He shook hands with great heartiness, and led
the way to the sitting room with a loud and
reassuring tread.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">99</a></span>
&ldquo;Visitors, Chip, old man,&rdquo; he announced, and
flung open the door.
</p>

<p>
Chip was lying stretched out on the sofa, pillows
behind his head and a striped rug across
his knees. His quiet manner of welcoming them
seemed to Judy to contrast almost humorously
with his friend&rsquo;s bluff cheeriness.
</p>

<p>
He had a nervous little speech all ready for
them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be the cause of
all this bother. It&rsquo;s most awfully good of you to
come. You&rsquo;ll forgive my not getting up, won&rsquo;t
you? I&rsquo;m not allowed to, for some reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should hope not,&rdquo; said Noel, as they shook
hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As for being a bother,&rdquo; Judy told him, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the sort of thing invalids say when they know
they&rsquo;re not strong enough to be shaken. Major
Crosby, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry we
are.&rdquo; She hurried on, fearful of showing emotion.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not say any more about that part
of it. You know what we feel.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; put in Major Stroud, after
the manner of Major Strouds, &ldquo;accidents will
happen, ye know, and as I tell Chip, he simply
barged into you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s silly, both sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
saying it&rsquo;s their fault. But there are two good
things about it. The doctor says you&rsquo;ll soon be
all right again, and&mdash;well, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
what happened that night, we&rsquo;d never have met,
would we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good effort, Judy,&rdquo; Noel encouraged
her. &ldquo;I second everything you&rsquo;ve said. But let&rsquo;s
cut out speeches now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They all laughed, and after that it was easier
to talk.
</p>

<p>
Major Stroud monopolized Noel, to whom he
seemed to have taken a great fancy, and Judy
found herself cut off from the other two, in a
chair beside the sofa. For there is no room so
small that a party of four cannot quite easily
split up into twos.
</p>

<p>
Major Crosby looked much as Judy had expected
him to look. That first sight of his face
in the light from the car&rsquo;s lamps was, she knew,
one of those mind pictures that refuse to fade.
She was uncertain about the color of his eyes,
which now proved to be gray, and though they
smiled and had a habit of smiling as the lines
about them showed, there were other lines about
the forehead that spoke of anxiety. His hair
was of that fine and unreliable quality that abandons
its owner early in life, and Chip was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
a little thin about the top. His long legs under
the rug displayed pointed knees, and he moved
his thin, well-shaped hands nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I can only put him at his ease with me!&rdquo;
thought Judy.
</p>

<p>
They talked commonplaces at first, and then,
stretching out her hand, she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I see what you were reading?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He picked up a finely bound book that lay beside
him on the rug, and gave it to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;but
one always feels slightly apologetic when discovered
reading poetry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was <cite>The Spirit of Man</cite>, and Judy was
conscious of a feeling of satisfaction. They liked
the same books, then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dear friend,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really? I&rsquo;m glad of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see this,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when I was
prowling about the room the other night. For I
did prowl, I admit it, and I found nothing but
books on religion. You see I had to do something
while I was waiting for the verdict.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect it was in my room,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;When the book I&rsquo;m working on gets the better
of me, or when I&rsquo;m tired of it, I turn to that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very wise.&rdquo; She put the book on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
table. &ldquo;Now tell me about your own book.
Major Stroud spoke of it the other night, and
seemed to think it was to blame for the accident.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He thinks it&rsquo;s to blame for everything. It&rsquo;s
very dull, I&rsquo;m afraid. It&rsquo;s about religions.
They&rsquo;re my hobby. Not religion; religions.
There&rsquo;s a difference, you see. I&rsquo;ve tried to write
a book that &hellip; well, how shall I explain
it? &hellip; pulls them all together. Brings out their
similarities. Fuses them, so to speak. It&rsquo;s tremendously
interesting work and means a lot of
research, and I like that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long have you been working on it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh &hellip; not very long. Let me see.&hellip; I
started it in 1910. Twelve years. Well, I suppose
that is a fairly long time. But you see the
war interrupted things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There were four years when I suppose you
did no work on it at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I managed to get in a lot of reading. I was
studying Druidism when I was in the trenches&mdash;most
absorbing study. That was when things
were fairly peaceful, of course. And when they
weren&rsquo;t peaceful, one was &hellip; well, testing various
beliefs, if you know what I mean. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
there was heavy shelling, for instance, and you
had to sit tight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She smiled at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it nearly done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, the bulk of it&rsquo;s done, but I&rsquo;m always
adding things to it. You see I want it to be a
sort of book of reference. If you want to find
out where Mohammedanism resembles Buddhism
you turn to where the two things are compared,
belief by belief. But all this is very boring for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. I like it. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s
extraordinary, with all the guidance that it has,
that mankind goes so frightfully astray?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it is. But I always think that we
expect too much of our fellow man. He&rsquo;s all
right. Only give him time. He&rsquo;s got such a lot
to unlearn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean he has all his brutal beginnings to
forget?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I imagine I see him evoluting all the way
from brute to angel, or something like it. He&rsquo;s
about at Half Way House now, I think. Wars,
of course, give him a bit of a setback.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose they do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, rather! I&rsquo;m sure they do. Not necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
for every individual, you understand, but
for the mass. I hate guns and noise and warfare
like the majority of my kind. I always have
and I always shall. But at the same time, when
there&rsquo;s a fight on I&rsquo;ve got to be there, and if
there&rsquo;s going to be a top dog, I want my fellows
to be it. Half Way House, you see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you think we&rsquo;ll get beyond it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it for a moment. Do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I always think that mankind
looks its best under the microscope, so to speak,
and that it&rsquo;s rather horrible when you see it in
the mass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like mold?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Ferns and flowers
and lovely shapes when you magnify it, but
very nasty indeed when you look at it on a damp
wall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Just like that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes smiled back at his eyes. It was at
this moment that something greater than interest
awoke in her. She knew it was there; she was
aware of the very instant of its coming, and she
meant, later, to examine it at her leisure.
</p>

<p>
Noel and Major Stroud were engaged in
studying a map of the Somme, and were oblivious
to them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You really must meet my grandmother, Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Gregory&mdash;or Madame Claire, as Noel and I call
her. She&rsquo;s the most wonderful person. When
you&rsquo;re better you must come and have tea with
us at her hotel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like that very much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
get on quite well with old ladies. I find young
ones rather alarming nowadays, but perhaps it&rsquo;s
because I don&rsquo;t see much of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy laughed at this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I alarm you?&rdquo; she challenged him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd, but you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a blessing! Shy people&mdash;and I am one&mdash;usually
have the most devastating effect on
other shy people. But you&rsquo;ll love Madame
Claire. She looks on the world from a kind of
Olympus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yet most of us dread growing old,&rdquo; he remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous? But I don&rsquo;t. There
are times when I envy her her age, and her &hellip;
imperviousness. What a word!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s temperamental, that sort of thing. It&rsquo;s
the people who are always seeking gayety that
dread old age most. Being Scotch I like grayness,
and austere hills, and quiet and mystery. All
old things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Chip was surprised at the ease with which he
could talk about himself. He felt half apologetic
and looked at Judy as if to say, &ldquo;Forgive me,
but it must be some spell that you have cast upon
me.&hellip;&rdquo; A look passed between them then
that was to both of them an unforgettable thing.
</p>

<p>
Their words had meant nothing, but they were
mutually aware of a bond&mdash;a thing as fine as
gossamer, and as strong as London Bridge. Judy
was conscious of a queer little electric thrill that
she felt to the very tips of her fingers. Their
look had so plainly said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You and I.&hellip; We are going to be something
to each other. What will that something
be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To cover the nakedness of that question that
each was aware of in the mind of the other, Judy
turned away her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel,&rdquo; she said, raising her voice, &ldquo;Major
Crosby and Major Stroud must come to tea at
Madame Claire&rsquo;s one day. Can&rsquo;t we decide on
an afternoon now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Being one of the unemployed,&rdquo; Noel answered
cheerfully, &ldquo;all afternoons are alike to me. When
will they let you up again, Major Crosby?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in three or four days I expect
to be carrying on as usual.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
They decided on the following Thursday, provided
Madame Claire had no other engagement,
and soon Noel and Judy, for fear of tiring their
victim, got up to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll come and see me again, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; asked Chip, then added, &ldquo;but dash it all, I
forgot! I&rsquo;ll be up soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They laughed, and his regret that they might
not come again was so real that Judy said as they
shook hands:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget; Madame Claire&rsquo;s on Thursday,
at four.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Major Stroud went out with them, leaving
Chip looking after them rather wistfully.
</p>

<p>
Talking to her had been strangely easy as he
lay there. It might never be the same again.
He had looked at her to his heart&rsquo;s content, a
thing he wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to do had they been
talking in the ordinary way. His recollections of
the accident were very confused. He had been
conscious of some one at intervals&mdash;a sort of
delightful presence. Major Stroud had filled in
the rest for him&mdash;badly enough. The Major did
not excel in word pictures.
</p>

<p>
Was she pretty &hellip; beautiful? He searched
for the right word. She was lovely, that was
it &hellip; lovely. She had taken off her gloves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
her long ringless hands had lain in her lap as
she talked. She was tall, but not too tall. He
liked a woman to have height. He liked the paleness
of her oval face, and the wide mouth with
its satisfactory curves. Her dark brown eyes
had a sparkle far at the back of them, like &hellip;
like the reflection of a single star in a deep
pool.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
He had been damned dull, as he always was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she were only sitting there again,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;I would say everything differently. I
would say things that she might remember afterwards.
I&rsquo;m not such a dull fellow as all that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Was he not? At least no woman would ever
find out that he was not. He thought of his poverty
and his book, that, in all probability, he
alone believed in. He realized that his head had
begun to ache again, and he closed his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Major Stroud went with Noel and Judy as far
as the street door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; he assured them, indicating
Chip upstairs. &ldquo;Nothing to worry about
now. Rest&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; him good. Awfully good of
you to come, Miss Pendleton, cheer him up. Terrible
fellow for bein&rsquo; alone, Chip is. Neglects
his friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he any relations?&rdquo; Noel asked.
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Major Stroud shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Orphan &hellip; only child, too. He doesn&rsquo;t see
enough people. Not like me; I like to keep
goin&rsquo; &hellip; gaddin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy was amused at this. Solid, heavy Major
Stroud, picturing himself as a sort of social
butterfly!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you two see a good deal of each other,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Judy wanted to feel sure that Chip
was not altogether alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lord, yes! Good old Chip! Been
through two campaigns together.&rdquo; Then as Judy
held out her hand, &ldquo;&rsquo;By, Miss Pendleton. I&rsquo;ll
let you know how he gets on. Ought to be out
to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked briskly down Church Street, Judy
with an arm through Noel&rsquo;s, and her chin buried
in her furs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she echoed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said it first,&rdquo; remarked her brother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Translated, I take it to mean, how do I like
Chip? Is that it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have put it better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like him immensely,&rdquo; said Judy obligingly.
&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
&ldquo;Same here.&rdquo; Then after a pause, &ldquo;Feeling
less spinsterish?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel in the least spinsterish, thank
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never saw you looking less
so. Chip, poor devil, lay there and gazed with
his soul in his eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Noel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fact. But you&rsquo;ll have to change your methods.
You&rsquo;ll have to cut that &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll have to come
all the way to me&rsquo; business. Because he won&rsquo;t;
he&rsquo;s too shy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy would have been in a cold fury had any
one else dared to speak so to her, but she took
it from Noel with perfect good humor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I gather you&rsquo;d like me to see more of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, why not? If ever a man needed some
woman to take an interest in him, that man is
Chip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He may need it, but from the little I&rsquo;ve seen
of him I don&rsquo;t think he wants it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he wants it. He&rsquo;s human. I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind having him in the family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy had to laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s rather soon to make up
your mind? After all, you hardly know him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. I liked him the first minute
I saw him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have the impulsiveness of extreme
youth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so trite,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;to throw my
youth at me. You only say that when you can&rsquo;t
think of anything else to say. You must cultivate
originality of thought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s good manners
to adjust one&rsquo;s conversation to suit one&rsquo;s hearers.
Now let&rsquo;s continue about Chip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has no money,&rdquo; he went on, quite unruffled,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a pity, because you won&rsquo;t get
much from the family. Gordon will get it all.
But you&rsquo;d make a better poor man&rsquo;s wife than
most girls. What about the simple life for a
change?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You go too fast, my friend. I&rsquo;ve nothing
against the simple life&mdash;though why they call it
that I can&rsquo;t think; there&rsquo;s nothing less simple
than trying to live on nothing a year. But what I
wish to point out to you is that Major Crosby, to
begin with, is not a marrying man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; groaned Noel, &ldquo;what a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clich&eacute;</span>!
How can a man be a marrying man until he marries?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To put it into words of one syllable, Major
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Crosby is not the sort of man who contemplates
marriage. He is wedded to his bachelorhood and
his book.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tosh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I very much hope he will
let us be his friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll let us right enough; if that&rsquo;s what
you want. By the way, we mustn&rsquo;t let the Bennetts
know about the accident.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mills tell them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not he. I fixed it up with old Mills. Mrs.
Bennett is a nice old thing, but she&rsquo;d fuss, and
Chip would hate that. I&rsquo;m glad we let him think
it was our car. We can explain to him some day.
You see, it really was his fault. He didn&rsquo;t look
where he was going&mdash;didn&rsquo;t even stop to listen,
Mills says. But I don&rsquo;t want him to think we
think that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, Noel. It&rsquo;s getting too
complicated for me.&rdquo; Then she remembered
something.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you know Eric had gone to Paris to
fetch Aunt Connie home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He whistled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. Nobody told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Claire only told me this morning. Eric has
wired for rooms for her in some small hotel, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Half Moon Street, I think. They&rsquo;ll be back to-morrow.
Won&rsquo;t it be queer to have an aunt
we&rsquo;ve never seen since we were children?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He agreed that it would.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I shall rather like having a dissipated
aunt,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of the common.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect people have exaggerated things,&rdquo;
Judy said. &ldquo;And besides, she&rsquo;s getting on, you
know. She&rsquo;s only a year or two younger than
mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her sort never change,&rdquo; said the sage. &ldquo;What
about that rotten little Count?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Eric means to do about
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I know two people at least who will
raise a row about her coming home. Mother and
Louise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s told them yet,&rdquo; said Judy.
</p>

<p>
He whistled again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see trouble ahead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As they reached the house in Eaton Square
the front door opened, and the figure of an
immaculately dressed young man was sharply
silhouetted against the yellow light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, you two!&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
Gordon was extremely good-looking in his fair
and rather wooden way. His beautiful evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
clothes looked resplendent, and the coat he carried
over one arm was there as a concession to his
mother, for he was never cold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, Gordon!&rdquo; echoed the other two.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo; demanded the elder
brother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Been to see a sick friend,&rdquo; said Noel.
</p>

<p>
Gordon looked at his sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you coming to Lady Ottway&rsquo;s dance to-night?
You were asked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. But I&rsquo;m not coming. I can&rsquo;t stand
her dances. I may be slow, but they&rsquo;re slower
still.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you can&rsquo;t stand her,&rdquo; advised Gordon,
bending his handsome head to light a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not? If I feel like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He threw away the match and puffed experimentally
on the cigarette. Then, satisfied of a
light, he said casually:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s going to be my mother-in-law.
That&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gordon!&rdquo; they exclaimed together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fact. All arranged yesterday. Helen and
I hope to be married early in June. So congratulate
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gordon!&rdquo; cried Judy again, &ldquo;what a queer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
boy you are! I hadn&rsquo;t an inkling it had happened.&rdquo;
She raised her face to kiss him, but he
drew back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not on the front steps. Keep that for later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like you,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;No one
can see us. Anyway, Gordon, consider yourself
kissed, and I do congratulate you, my dear, and
I&rsquo;m happy if you are. Does mother know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes. She&rsquo;s delighted, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel put his hand on Gordon&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad, Gordon old man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He went down the steps and hailed
a taxi that was crawling toward them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have
told you before,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder, &ldquo;only
we don&rsquo;t keep the same hours. Never sure of
seeing you. Well, so long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The taxi door shut with a bang that echoed
loudly in the quiet square, and he was off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Gordon all over?&rdquo; asked Noel.
</p>

<p>
As Judy entered the hall she gave a little laugh
that was almost a sob, and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank God for you, Noel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Madame Claire</span>
was at her desk, writing. She
was writing to Stephen, and when she did that
she gave her whole attention to it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;I am so sorry you are feeling less well. How
is the phlebitis? No one ought to suffer from
anything with such a pretty name. Did you ever
stop to think that the names of diseases and the
names of flowers are very similar? For instance,
I might say, &lsquo;Do come and see my garden. It
is at its best now, and the double pneumonias are
really wonderful. I suppose the mild winter had
something to do with that. I&rsquo;m very proud of my
trailing phlebitis, too, and the laryngitises and
deep purple quinsies that I put in last year are a
joy to behold. The bed of asthmas and malarias
that you used to admire is finer than ever this
summer, and the dear little dropsies are all in
bloom down by the lake, and make such a pretty
showing with the blue of the anthrax border
behind them!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enough of nonsense. There is a great deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to tell you. I wrote you that Eric was on his way
to Paris to fetch Connie. He found her, where
I thought he would, and they returned to London
together. He took rooms for her in a quiet little
hotel, which I fear was a mistake, for Connie
loathes quiet little hotels, and only goes to them
when she must. However, we shall see. She
came to see me the other day&mdash;poor Connie!
She is, to use her own words, a wreck of a woman,
but she trails the ghost of her beauty about with
her, and Eric tells me people still turn to stare
after her in the streets. She tried to talk to me
as if we had parted only yesterday, and was as
unemotional as one could wish, for which I was
thankful, for emotions are only permissible when
they are genuine, and not always then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I am a very odd old woman,
Stephen, but I only felt for her what I would
have felt for any other woman in her position.
I had to keep reminding myself that this once
beautiful, made-up woman was my daughter. I
have never known that feverish mother-love that
so many women experience. My children interested,
amused and disappointed me&mdash;when I was
stupid enough to be disappointed. I know better
now. I would die for any of my children, but I
cannot sentimentalize over them.
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
&ldquo;How I digress! Connie is going to give London
a try, and I hope to Heaven she will find
something to interest her. She has no friends,
so she will have to fall back, I suppose, on shops
and theaters, and of course clothes, which she still
loves. But she is not a woman to &lsquo;take up&rsquo; things.
I wish she were.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you will be most interested in Judy. I
wrote you about the near-accident, and the man
who was knocked down in the fog. He appears
to have captivated both Judy and Noel, and they
are bringing him here to tea this afternoon. I
am most anxious to meet him, for something tells
me that Judy is more interested in him than she
has ever been in any man. But more of that in
my next letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louise returns of her own free will&mdash;which
must annoy her&mdash;to-morrow. I think she deferred
her homecoming in the hope that Eric
would send for her, but instead of that he begged
her to stay as long as she wished. She has never
met Connie, and of course they will dislike each
other. At present neither she nor Millie know
of Connie&rsquo;s return. I thought it better to let her
take root a little first, for I think any unpleasantness
during the first week or two would easily
dislodge her.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
&ldquo;I do hope to see you here, Stephen. Do you
plan and hope for it too?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will write again very soon.

<p>
She always sent Dawson out to post her letters
to Stephen the moment they were written. She
knew he had not her vitality nor her interests.
There was little to hold him to life except her
letters, and the hope he had of seeing her and
those about her again.

<div class="chapter">
    <p><a name="linkChapter11" id="linkChapter11"></a>

        </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Louise</span>
returned to London in a strange state of
mind. In the first place, her family, who liked
Eric, had not been disposed to listen sympathetically
to her rather vague complaints. She had
found her sister, an enthusiastic gardener, preoccupied
and full of plans for altering the gardens
of Mistley; her mother too engrossed with
Theosophy to listen to earthly troubles, and her
father too much upset over the budget. So she
had been left to herself more than she had liked.
She had made up her mind to stay until Eric expressed
a desire for her return, but as he did no
such thing, and she felt she couldn&rsquo;t stand another
hour of boredom, she returned to town.
</p>

<p>
And there was something else. The day before
she left, a humble cousin of her mother&rsquo;s
came to tea. She had been to Paris for the first
time in her life, and was not to be denied the
greater joy of relating her impressions. The rest
of the family, murmuring appropriate excuses,
drifted away after tea, and Louise was left alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
with the caller. It was then that Louise received
a shock.
</p>

<p>
She heard that her husband had been seen in
Paris. It came out quite naturally during the
conversation. It also appeared that he had been
seen at some private hotel with a lady. &ldquo;I dare
say&mdash;a relation?&rdquo; The cousin&rsquo;s voice had an inquiring
note. &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll know who it was
if I describe her. A tall lady, my friend said, not
very young. Fair.&rdquo; And Louise said, with her
brain whirling, &ldquo;Oh, yes, a cousin.&ldquo; The visitor
nodded. &ldquo;So odd, wasn&rsquo;t it, my friend having
seen your husband? One never expects to see
any one one knows in Paris. It&rsquo;s not like dear
London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise was so amazed that she forgot to feel
angry and outraged. She thought of it most of
the night, and in the train next morning, and she
thought of it&mdash;and it seemed stranger than ever
then&mdash;when she was once more in her own home,
among the familiar things she had lived with for
eight years.
</p>

<p>
Eric was at the House. She couldn&rsquo;t remember
whether it was Divorce Reform or the Plumage
Bill. Anyway, he wasn&rsquo;t expected back till late.
She longed for some one to talk to. She had no
intimate woman friend with whom she could discuss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
her husband; in fact, she could think of no
better ear in which to pour her troubled amazement
than that of her husband&rsquo;s mother.
</p>

<p>
Lady Gregory was in, Dawson said over the
telephone, and was not expecting visitors. She
would be delighted to see Mrs. Eric.
</p>

<p>
If Louise had been accustomed to self-examination,
she would have realized that she was less
unhappy than she had been for some years. She
was indeed conscious of an odd satisfaction. Eric,
then, was less perfect than his friends and family
believed. There was a chink in that shining armor,
his light had suddenly become dimmed.
That woman in Paris&mdash;she was not young&mdash;it had
evidently been going on for years. Or was it the
renewal of some old affair? Her informant had
managed to convey to her that her husband&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;cousin
did you say?&rdquo;&mdash;had not looked&mdash;well&mdash;quite
of their world. She was thankful for that.
When Eric admired Lady Norah Thorpe-Taylor,
or Mrs. Dennison, or that hideous, clever Madame
Fonteyn, she resented it bitterly, for she
knew they had what she had not&mdash;charm. So
she scoffed at charm, and prided herself on having
none, nor wishing to have.
</p>

<p>
But here was something different; here was a
blemish in the fabric, a rotten spot brought for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
the first time to light. It put her on a new footing
with him, a slightly elevated footing. Let
him point, if he could, to anything unworthy in
her life. She had always believed him to be fastidious.
Well, he was not. But she was&mdash;perhaps
she was too fastidious; but then she had the
defects of her qualities. Let others touch pitch
and be soiled. She could almost pity Eric for
lacking what she had. After all, he was merely
common clay, and she had been expected to prostrate
herself before an idol. Ridiculous! She
would try to forgive him. Perhaps he had found
her difficult to live up to.
</p>

<p>
She grew greatly in her own eyes. She no
longer felt herself dwarfed by him. He must
understand that. Then she would forgive and
forget&mdash;except at such times as it might suit her
to remember.
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, how much better you look!&rdquo; cried
Madame Claire, as Louise came into the room.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a different creature. Come and tell me
all about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Dawson took her hat and coat, Louise made
a mental note that it was time she had new ones.
Later on, she might perhaps run over to Paris
for a few days, and buy clothes there. Why not?
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
&ldquo;Do I really look better? I feel it. It&rsquo;s been
a delightful change, and of course one&rsquo;s family
do appreciate one. It&rsquo;s like renewing one&rsquo;s girlhood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an affected speech!&rdquo; thought Madame
Claire. &ldquo;Louise has something on her mind.&rdquo;
She then said aloud:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It amuses me to hear you talk about renewing
your girlhood. How old are you? I&rsquo;ve a
dreadful memory for these things. Thirty-five?
Ridiculously young. I always feel you don&rsquo;t make
the most of your youth and good looks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise gave a few touches to her hair before
a mirror, and took a chair on the other side of
the fireplace. There was something very restful
about this room of Madame Claire&rsquo;s. And her
mother-in-law was a woman without prejudices,
even where her own children were concerned. She
felt she had done the right thing in coming to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you be surprised to hear that I am
going to turn over a new leaf? I feel I&rsquo;ve been
very much to blame. I&rsquo;ve allowed myself to play
third fiddle long enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Madame Claire. &ldquo;And what
else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; went on the younger woman, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
hint of defiance in her voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
stand in awe of Eric any longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In awe&mdash;of Eric?&rdquo; Madame Claire laughed.
&ldquo;My dear Louise, that you&rsquo;ve certainly never
done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s what I was always expected to do.
I&rsquo;ve thought a good deal about what you said
the last time I was here. You were partly right.
I suppose I have sulked. Well, I&rsquo;m not going to
sulk any more. Eric isn&rsquo;t a demi-god. I know
now there&rsquo;s no earthly reason why I should look
up to him, and admire him. He&rsquo;s just like any
other man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I could have told you that any time these
last eight years!&rdquo; cried Madame Claire, more
puzzled than amused. &ldquo;And besides, you yourself
seem to have been well acquainted with his
failings. I have sometimes thought you saw
nothing else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I was annoyed by his perfections.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perfections! My dear, I could swear Eric
has never been a prig!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he never seemed to make mistakes like
other people. And he always seemed to expect
things of me that I wasn&rsquo;t capable of. It got on
my nerves.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He always made me feel I was disappointing
him. And that isn&rsquo;t very pleasant. But now,&rdquo;
said Louise, coming to the crux of the matter,
&ldquo;he has disappointed me. So we are quits at
last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Madame Claire, still in the dark.
&ldquo;That must be a relief.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oddly enough, it is a relief. Horrible as the
whole thing is, I&mdash;I could almost be glad of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was wrong,&rdquo; thought Madame Claire, remembering
a conversation she had had with Judy.
&ldquo;Eric is interested in some other woman, at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is this horrible thing?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may as well hear it,&rdquo; said Louise recklessly.
&ldquo;If I can bear it, I should think you
could too. While I was away, Eric wired me he
was going out of town for a few days. He didn&rsquo;t
say where. I know now. He was seen at a small
hotel in Paris with a&mdash;a questionable-looking
woman. So our idol has feet of clay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was both bitterness and triumph in her
voice. Madame Claire gripped the arms of her
chair and tried not to laugh. What should she
do? Good had been known to come out of evil.
Should she and Eric let Louise think&mdash;what she
thought? Her crying need was evidently to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
find Eric in the wrong. Should they let her?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t a shock to me,&rdquo; Louise
went on. &ldquo;It was. I heard it while I was at
Mistley. I know that it is true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire was thinking:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is bound to know the facts sooner or
later, and then she&rsquo;ll feel she has been made a
fool of&mdash;a thing only saints can forgive. And
yet, it&rsquo;s an opportunity of a sort. But what a
paltry business!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose this were really true, Louise,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;At the moment I am neither denying the
possibility of it, nor affirming it. But suppose
it were true. How would it affect your feeling
for Eric?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As a good woman&mdash;and I hope I am that&mdash;it
revolts me. But &hellip; perhaps I&rsquo;ve been hard
&hellip; perhaps he&rsquo;s found a lack in me.&hellip; I
dare say he has.&hellip; Oh!&rdquo; she cried suddenly
with real emotion, &ldquo;I want to forgive him! I
would forgive him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire felt she was hearing something
she had no right to hear. She must leave this
to Eric. Stupid mistake as it was, it might be
the means of clearing the air. She would have
nothing to do with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
you have told me this. Later you&rsquo;ll understand
why. I think the whole thing can be explained,
but for your explanation I prefer you should go
to Eric. It concerns him the most.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She would hear no more of it. There was
something indecent in Louise&rsquo;s willingness to forgive.
While they talked of other things her indignation
grew. Eric&rsquo;s wife wanted to believe the
worst of him. By the time her visitor was ready
to go, she found it difficult to be polite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am delighted to see you looking so much
better, and so much more cheerful,&rdquo; she told her,
as she said good-by. &ldquo;And should there prove
to be nothing in this story, don&rsquo;t be disheartened.
You mustn&rsquo;t let one disappointment discourage
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louise, wondering what she meant, kissed her
mechanically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by. I&rsquo;ll come and see you again in a
few days if I may.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do. I shall expect really good news from
you then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the door had closed on her, Madame
Claire sat looking into the fire with a flush on her
cheeks. Presently she took from a bowl on the
table beside her a few violets, and after wiping
their stems, tucked them into her dress.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
&ldquo;You deserve a bouquet,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;for not having been ruder. I expect they&rsquo;re
writing in their book up aloft, &lsquo;January 30, Madame
Claire rather less pleasant to-day to her
irritating daughter-in-law.&rsquo; Well, let them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
Louise went home and dressed for dinner feeling
like a warrior on the eve of battle. There
had been many coldnesses in that house, but, as
far back as she could remember, not a single
contretemps. Dinner was at half-past eight, and
there was a possibility that Eric would be late.
They usually dined at eight, but the Plumage Bill&mdash;or
was it the Divorce Reform Bill?&mdash;would
keep him. She did her hair in a way that he had
once admired, and put on a blue tea-gown that he
had called charming. In fact, she took far greater
pains over her r&ocirc;le as injured wife than she had
ever taken before. And saw no humor in it either.
</p>

<p>
Eric thought he had never seen her look so well.
Take away her coldness and her pettiness, he said
to himself, and she would be lovely. Perhaps if
she had married some one else she would have
been neither cold nor petty. He often felt very
sorry for her, for though he had made the mistake,
she, no doubt, suffered the most. They
talked commonplaces during dinner, but once they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
were alone in the library, Louise confronted him
with heightened color and a voice she could barely
control.
</p>

<p>
It was a pitiful little comedy. Her triumph
was so short lived, and the bubble of her advantage
over him so soon pricked. At the end of it
she found refuge from her humiliation in tears.
Eric had never seen her cry like that before, and
it moved him. He felt like confessing to things
he had never done, or abasing himself in some
way. He understood her for the first time, and
though there was something ignoble in it all, and
he felt the prickings of anger, he nevertheless
thought her very human, at least, in wanting to
find some weakness to forgive him for.
</p>

<p>
He put his arm about her, half laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Louise, don&rsquo;t be so cast down.
There&rsquo;s always the stage door&mdash;or I could forge
a check to oblige, or elope with your maid. What
would you like me to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made no answer, but buried her wet face
in a cushion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or why not just forgive me on general principles
for being a stupid fellow, and not understanding
you? I expect I often hurt you when I
am least aware of it. We humans are like that&mdash;we
understand each other&rsquo;s sensibilities so little.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Why not forgive me for that? Forgive me for
not having known how to make you happier?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are making fun of me,&rdquo; she sobbed.
&ldquo;You are only sneering at me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Something told him that she was softening, that
soon she would be talking with him like a reasonable
being. Was it possible that from to-night he
might feel he had a friend for a wife instead of
an enemy? He knew he must not let pride stand
in the way of it&mdash;nor justice even. There was
nothing to be gained and much to be lost by telling
her that during the whole of their married life
she had persistently played the fool.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On my honor I am not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Louise,
listen to me. I am a blundering fellow. Somehow
or other I have always failed to give you
what you wanted. That being so, I ask your help.
Help me to be what you wish me to be. We are
young, and there is still time. I will do anything.
I beg you to help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He made her raise her head, and looked her
full in the face with all the intensity those blazing
blue eyes of his were capable of.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was undoubtedly the great moment of
Louise&rsquo;s life. She knew it. Eric had made it possible
for her to be magnanimous. But the gods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
were not kind. What she was going to say to him
they alone knew, for at that instant the maid came
to the door, to say that Countess Chiozzi was on
the telephone and would like to speak to Mr.
Gregory. For Louise the interruption was maddening.
Eric was about to send word that he
would ring her up in the morning, and so return
as quickly as possible to the business in hand, when
Louise said in a stifled voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want it clearly understood that that woman
is not to come into this house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was hopeless, then. Eric turned to the maid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to her,&rdquo; he said, and left the room.
They would have to separate. There was nothing
else for it.
</p>

<p>
Louise sat with bent head, smoothing out a
handkerchief on her knee. She had not meant
to say that. The words had come through sheer
force of habit. She knew her moment was gone
now, and she believed that it would never come
again. If Eric had really loved her, he would
have seen that she longed to be different, and that
under her coldness and bitterness there was only
unhappiness and longing! He ought to have
<em>seen</em>! She folded the handkerchief and pressed
it to her eyes again. She was more miserable than
ever.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Major Stroud</span>
had also been invited to tea at
Madame Claire&rsquo;s, but was to be out of town, and
as Noel had to see a man about a job, the party
had dwindled to three, and Chip found his way
to the hotel alone. He was prompt to the minute
and feeling extremely nervous. He had so looked
forward to seeing Judy again that he felt sure
everything&mdash;except Judy herself&mdash;would be disappointing.
Madame Claire would find him uninteresting,
and Judy would be kind but bored. He
would very likely upset his tea. He had been a
fool to accept. He had far better have stayed
away and allowed himself to return to the comfortable
oblivion from which the accident had dislodged
him. Better be a kindly memory than a
dull actuality.
</p>

<p>
But there was something reassuring about the
way the homely Dawson opened the door to him
and took his hat and coat. She received him like
an old friend and smiled as though she shared
some secret with him. The sight of Judy and his
hostess bending over plans for a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pis&eacute; de Terre</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
cottage to be built for Judy on Madame Claire&rsquo;s
little place in Sussex, also gave him courage. He
loved plans, and was soon making suggestions and
alterations in a way that, Judy said, was as domineering
as an architect&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s entirely furnished and decorated inside,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about it so much that I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find it had materialized.
You must look next time you go down, Madame
Claire. It might look rather odd without its outsides
of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It had long been a dream of Judy&rsquo;s to have her
own cottage&mdash;shared, needless to say, with Noel&mdash;and
if they could only get it built cheaply
enough, there was a chance that it might be fulfilled.
At any rate, they enjoyed planning it, and
if it served no other purpose it put Chip at his
ease with them&mdash;a thing she had prayed for.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire guessed easily enough that he
was on the way to falling in love with Judy, and
that Judy herself was on the same road. She
thought there was something very lovable about
Chip, and felt sure that he was as gallant a soldier
as he was a modest one. Major Stroud had more
than hinted to Judy that his
<dfn title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</dfn> should have
been a
<dfn title="Victoria Cross">V.C.</dfn>
Madame Claire loved a good soldier,
for she had a theory that to be a good soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
a man must be a great gentleman. And, like Judy,
she felt the charm of the man of forty&mdash;the age
that lies like a savory filling between what is callow
in the young generation and outworn in the
old.
</p>

<p>
His poverty had kept him out of touch with
things. She guessed that if he danced at all, it
would be in the stiff, uncompromising manner of
the late nineties. He should learn the new ways.
He wasn&rsquo;t nearly old enough to think of himself
as on the shelf.
</p>

<p>
Judy inquired about his injuries. Had the stiffness
nearly gone? No, it was no good his saying
that it had entirely gone, because she had noticed
that he was limping slightly when he came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s old age,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well. Only don&rsquo;t forget to limp the next
time we meet. And what about your head?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, quite recovered, thanks! That is, it aches
a bit, of course, if I do much writing, but the
doctor says that&rsquo;s bound to be so for a while.
Really,&rdquo; he said, turning to Madame Claire, &ldquo;I
feel I owe my life to Miss Pendleton and her
chauffeur. Any one else would have run gayly
over me and gone on. I think it was such amazingly
good luck that it happened to be that particular
car.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather inclined to agree with you,&rdquo;
laughed Madame Claire. &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;d like to
hear something about your book. It sounds tremendously
interesting. But what I&rsquo;d like to know
now is this. Are all your eggs in one basket? I
mean, does this book occupy your whole time, or
do you work on it when other occupations permit?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that &hellip; well, that not only are
all my eggs in one basket, but that there&rsquo;s only
one egg. You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I chucked the
army in order to give all my time to it. It meant
as much to me as that. To my mind, no one&rsquo;s
ever written scientifically enough about religions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That may be, but I feel you need diversions.
When people become so obsessed by one idea that
they walk under omnibuses and into motor cars,
it&rsquo;s time for an antidote.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I did,&rdquo; he admitted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well then, I suggest diversions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what sort? I play golf now and then, but
it doesn&rsquo;t take my mind off the book. Why, I
remember perfectly solving a problem once&mdash;it
had something to do, I think, with levitation&mdash;while
I was trying to get my ball out of a bunker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire laughed heartily.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a most unusual man then. What else
can we think of, Judy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always dancing,&rdquo; said Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dancing! Of course! He must learn to
dance. You can&rsquo;t dance and think about religions.
I defy you to do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t dance. I&rsquo;m too old and stiff.
Besides, no one would dance with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three excuses, and none of them any good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;I might even
dance with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you really? That&rsquo;s awfully kind. But
I ought to tell you that I really don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
teachable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must let me judge of that. We might
begin at Eaton Square one night, in a small way.
Gordon and Noel and I often ask a few friends
in for dancing, and there&rsquo;s a little anteroom reserved
for practicing. There will only be a few,
and it won&rsquo;t be at all alarming even for hermits.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chip looked pleased and dubious at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any flappers, will there? I&rsquo;m
terrified of flappers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing more flapperish than myself,&rdquo;
laughed Judy. &ldquo;Was I ever a flapper, Madame
Claire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
&ldquo;Never. Millie kept you out of sight until you
were able to fly. I didn&rsquo;t altogether approve.
After all, we must all try our wings some time.
You see, I like the present day, Major Crosby.
I like it far better than what people call my own
day, though why this one isn&rsquo;t just as much mine
as it is anybody&rsquo;s, I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very greedy,&rdquo; Judy told her. &ldquo;You
had Disraeli and Gladstone and Jenny Lind, and
now you want Lloyd George and Charlie Chaplin.
All the same, I don&rsquo;t wonder you like our age
best. That one was so full of hypocrisy and sentiment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire agreed with this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We were always pretending things. Men were
always gentlemen or monsters. Young girls were
always innocent as flowers. We even tried to believe
that wars and poverty were picturesque and
romantic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you talked too much about love,&rdquo; said
Judy. &ldquo;That sort of golden, sticky, picture-book
love that even we were taught to expect. And a
gigantic hoax it is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A hoax?&rdquo; Chip looked at her to see if she
were joking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it is. Oh, I believed in it too, once.
It&rsquo;s like Santa Claus. I never could see that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
pleasure of believing in him was worth the awfulness
of finding out that he&rsquo;s only a myth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chip wondered if she were making fun of love,
or whether she was merely holding the schoolgirl&rsquo;s
idea of it up to scorn. He didn&rsquo;t know.
He had never expected to find a love that would
transform the world, and he had found it. What
he had yet to discover was that women, after all,
are the terrible realists. Men manage to preserve
their illusions better. Few of them love
with their eyes open, and women only really love
when their eyes are open. For women are meant
to see faults, being the mothers of children, and
their critical faculties are more on the alert.

Judy had looked for a miracle. She had been
searching for a fairy castle, and now found herself
becoming interested in an imperfect modern
dwelling. Chip had not asked for a miracle, and
lo! it had come to pass. He listened to Judy
making fun of romantic love&mdash;which she did with
great satisfaction to herself until interrupted by
tea&mdash;and refused to believe that she meant what
she said. For romantic love does undoubtedly
come to very simple people, and Chip was very
simple.
</p>

<p>
He didn&rsquo;t trouble to disagree with her. He
was happy to be hearing from her own lips that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
she had never been in love. Not that it made any
difference, beyond the pleasure that it gave him,
for to love Judy was not the same thing where he
was concerned as to make love to her. That was
unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
They left Madame Claire&rsquo;s together at six, and
Chip, happily reckless as well as recklessly happy,
walked with Judy all the way to Eaton Square.
It was settled that he was to dine there and begin
his rejuvenation the following Wednesday night.
For Judy told herself that she couldn&rsquo;t keep Chip
a secret from the family forever, and they might
as well meet him and get done with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be frightened of mother,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is, but she does
frighten people. I don&rsquo;t think she wants to,
really. She and father are very keen on what
Noel calls the &lsquo;kin game.&rsquo; You know the sort of
thing I mean&mdash;who&rsquo;s related to who and how.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Chip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So perhaps you&rsquo;d better tell me some of your
family history. Then I could tell them, and you
won&rsquo;t be bothered. Because they&rsquo;re sure to want
to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She colored as she said it, and Chip guessed
that there were mortifying experiences behind her
warning.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
&ldquo;With all the pleasure in the world,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Only there isn&rsquo;t much to tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He made short work of what there was. His
father, Graham Crosby, an explorer well known
to geographical societies, had lost his life from
fever in a South American jungle at the age of
thirty-seven. His mother, faced with the prospect
of almost unendurable poverty, tried her
hand at novel writing. &ldquo;The sentimental kind
that you would have hated,&rdquo; he said with a smile.
However, they had an enormous success, and enabled
her to send her only son to Sandhurst. She
died at the close of the Boer War. They were
not related to any Crosbys that he knew of, except
some excessively dull ones who lived somewhere
near Aberdeen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very poor pickings for your mother, I&rsquo;m
afraid,&rdquo; he said with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
Chip left her at the door with his rather old-fashioned
bow, and she watched him until he
reached the corner. There he turned, as she had
guessed he would, and looked back, and as the
maid opened the door, she waved her hand to him
gayly. He walked stiffly, thanks to the accident,
and leaned a little on his stick. Dear old
Chip!&hellip;
</p>

<p>
So this was love! With her it took the form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
of a passionate tenderness. She wanted him to
have success, and happiness. She wanted to help
him to get them.
</p>

<p>
For Chip, the impossible thing that had happened
was too dazzling, as yet, to be more than
blinked at. It was as though an old dried stick
had burst into blossom and leaf. As though water
had been turned into wine. That Judy might be
persuaded to care for him in return never entered
his head. To love her was wonderful enough.
Let a man of her own world, a man of wealth and
standing, try to win her. Some day such a man
would succeed, and he would have to bear that as
he had borne lesser things. If his book received
recognition, he might continue to enjoy this delightful
friendship. If not, he must quietly drop
out of Judy&rsquo;s life. For he believed that a man
had no right to accept a charming woman&rsquo;s friendship
unless he could lay appropriate and frequent
sacrifices upon her altar. Which shows that the
world had been rolling along under Chip&rsquo;s very
nose without his having observed the manner of
its rolling.
</p>

<p>
One pleasure he permitted himself that day.
He went into a little flower shop in Church Street
and bought two dozen pink roses. It was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
his happiest moments; he had been so denied the
joy of giving. On his card he wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you will forgive me if I am doing a
presumptuous thing in sending you these few
flowers. But if they give you a little pleasure, I
shall be well content.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
He felt bold, because he had nothing to lose.
It was early February, too, with the softness of
coming spring in the air, and hope dies hard in
the spring, even at forty.

<span class="firstWord">Stephen&rsquo;s</span>
letter in reply to Madame Claire&rsquo;s last

and was not up to writing at any length.

better I see her casting longing glances at old
Jock Wetherby, who&rsquo;s got more ailments than the
doctors can put names to. But when I&rsquo;m at my
worst she clucks over me like a proud hen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie&rsquo;s Count seems to suspect collusion.
He tried to pump me about her yesterday. I was
out in the sun for five minutes, and he appeared
so promptly I think he&rsquo;d been waiting for me. As
soon as he began asking questions I had a coughing
fit, so he went away. From what I hear&mdash;for
I listen to gossip when it suits me to do so&mdash;Connie
could get a divorce ten times over. I expect
he misses her in a way. He found he could make
her suffer&mdash;an occupation his sort delights in.
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, Claire, my dear, I cannot write more

transient, as well as to young lovers, whose love
is perhaps transient.

<p>
Madame Claire answered almost at once:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">&ldquo;Dear Stephen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
</p>

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;I have your little poem by heart. Thank
you for it. The older I grow, the more I value
the poets. They are the bravest people I know,
for they sing in defiance of a world out of joint.
Think of touching the high peaks of rapture with
coal at its present price, in the midst of strikes,
and a much advertised crime wave! It is difficult
to see that the world has improved since the war,
but at least one can see that it has changed, and
I like to think that it <em>can</em> only change for the
better. So I cling to that thought and read the
poets, not being one of those who can help to
make it better. I feel about the world as I might
feel about an Inn where I have supped and been
kindly served. I hope it may flourish and not fall
into evil hands. Not that I expect to return. It
was, after all, only a night&rsquo;s stopping place. But
I should like other travelers to find it as I found
it, or somewhat better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy came here to tea a day or two ago, and
there came also the victim of the accident in the
fog. He is, or soon will be, in love with her, and
something of the sort is happening to Judy. If
anything should come of it&mdash;and I feel that it
may, things would not be easy for them. Millie
would give the clothes off her back, and so would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
John, for the eldest son, but they expect their
daughter to marry for a living. I would do what
I could, but that would be little. My income
since the war has dwindled surprisingly, and I
have some of Robert&rsquo;s poor relations to help. Of
course, from Millie&rsquo;s point of view, the man is
utterly unsuitable, but he is a gallant fellow, and
life has been none too kind to him. I fear, somehow,
that he is one of life&rsquo;s inexplicable failures,
but I like him none the less for that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie has conceived an extravagant admiration
for Noel. I think I said that she was not a
woman to take up things, but I was wrong, for
she has &lsquo;taken up&rsquo; Noel. And really, it is amazing
the change he has already wrought in her.
She takes his frankness and frequent scoldings in
a way I never dreamed she would. He is kindness
itself to her, takes her to theaters and concerts,
and seems to find her an amusing companion. He
thinks she has had a pretty bad time of it&mdash;though
he admits it&rsquo;s her own fault&mdash;and is bent
on cheering her up. She adores his brutal honesty
and his entire lack of respect for age, position,
or human frailties. The first time they
lunched together, they met at the Ritz, and Connie,
it appears, was ablaze with paint. Noel refused
to set foot in the dining room until she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
washed her face, and in the end she meekly sat
down with nothing more in the way of make-up
than a dusting of powder on her nose. Of course
he is a godsend to her. Millie is very angry with
me, and Louise will have none of her. Judy gets
on with her well enough, but she doesn&rsquo;t amuse
Judy as she does Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did I tell you Louise heard Eric was in Paris
with a &lsquo;questionable looking woman&rsquo;? She was
nobly prepared to forgive him, but when she
learned that it was only Connie, her humiliation
knew no bounds. I fear she is colder to him than
ever now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, they must all go through with it
as we did. I thank Heaven every day that Time
has given me the right to sit quietly on my hilltop.
I can still hear the sounds of the conflict
below, and the cries of the wounded, but though
they are my nearest and dearest I am too conscious
of the transience of things, too aware of
yesterdays and to-morrows&mdash;especially to-morrows&mdash;to
concern myself greatly. I want them
to be happy, but I know they won&rsquo;t be, and I am
not God to confer or withhold. I can do nothing
but laugh at or comfort them a little. Do you
think me hard? No, you know that I am not.
The happiest of them all is Noel, for he, like me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
is a looker-on. I don&rsquo;t know how he has managed
to exchange the arena for the spectators&rsquo; gallery,
but he has. I think it is because he wants nothing
for himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As for Gordon, he is too ambitious to be
happy. He is marrying partly to suit his mother,
and partly to gratify his passion for being among
the big-wigs, where of course, as Lord Ottway&rsquo;s
son-in-law, he will be. But he doesn&rsquo;t know his
Helen&mdash;yet. I think I do. Her chin is too long
and her nose too high.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the joy of wanting nothing! The joy of
being eighty and immune! But I, even I, have
one wish. And that is to see you, my old friend,
again. But it is a pleasant want, like a hunger
that is soon to be satisfied. For I feel I cannot
lose you. Here, or there&mdash;what does it matter?
I imagine you wince at that, foolish old Stephen!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Write to me soon. I do hope you are better.</p>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">It</span>
was February and it was sunny, and Noel had
persuaded Connie to take a little gentle exercise
in the Park.
</p>

<p>
She was finding London bearable, thanks to her
nephew, and although she had, she said, nothing
to look forward to, she was content with the present
as long as the present remained as it was now.
</p>

<p>
They were discussing men in general, a topic
that never lost its interest for Connie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t think why you&rsquo;re so keen on foreigners,&rdquo;
Noel remarked; then said in his merciless
way, &ldquo;the only Englishman you ever had much to
do with you ran away from.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie was quite soberly dressed in a dark blue
coat and skirt, relieved by furs, hat, shoes and
gloves of her favorite gray. She was no more
made up than most of the other women who
passed them. It was her forty-eighth birthday,
and to celebrate it they were going to lunch at
Claridge&rsquo;s later.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Foreigners interest me so much more,&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;They understand women.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
&ldquo;Too damn well,&rdquo; agreed Noel. &ldquo;Besides, the
sort of men you mean only understand one sort
of woman. They wouldn&rsquo;t understand Judy, for
instance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie smiled deprecatingly and put her head
on one side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, as to that, I&rsquo;m not sure I understand
her myself. Frankly, I&rsquo;m a little disappointed
in Judy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t appreciate her, Connie. That&rsquo;s
why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; No one ever took offense at Noel.
&ldquo;To my mind she isn&rsquo;t feminine enough. She&rsquo;s
handsome, but she has no magnetism, no allure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nice English girls don&rsquo;t go in for allure,&rdquo;
Noel said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; She laughed rather scornfully. &ldquo;Because
they don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed her nephew. &ldquo;And a good
thing too. Look where it landed you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re being rude and British, but I forgive
you. And at any rate, I have lived.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was Noel&rsquo;s turn to laugh scornfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lived! You surely don&rsquo;t call that living?
Junketing around Europe with a lot of bounders!
Why, Connie, you little innocent, you&rsquo;d have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
lived a whole lot more if you&rsquo;d stuck to Humphries
and brought up a family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She threw him an appealing look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might remember that it&rsquo;s my birthday,&rdquo;
she protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jove, that&rsquo;s so. And I&rsquo;m hungry. Let&rsquo;s start
walking toward Claridge&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Walk? It&rsquo;s too far. We must have a taxi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, we mustn&rsquo;t. Great Scott, Connie, we&rsquo;ve
only walked half a mile or so. What&rsquo;ll you do
in the next war?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, be nice to me then.&rdquo; She gave in as
she usually did. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m horribly worried.
I may have to go back to Chiozzi almost
any day. If he finds out where I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense. He can&rsquo;t make you go. You
ought to divorce the little beast. I don&rsquo;t call that
a marriage. And anyway, one more scandal
won&rsquo;t matter much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he any money of his own, or are you
supporting him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he has money of his own, but he&rsquo;s gambled
away most of it. He gambled away most of
mine, too. I didn&rsquo;t know how to stop it. Morton
Freeman ought to have tied it up in some way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
but you see he died so suddenly &hellip; that awful
<i>Titanic</i>.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What sort of a fellow was Freeman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very nice, and very fond of me. But you
don&rsquo;t like foreigners.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never said so. And besides, I don&rsquo;t call
Americans foreigners.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He stayed on the ship,&rdquo; Connie went on. &ldquo;He
made me go. It was so brave of him. I wasn&rsquo;t
really in love with him. I&rsquo;ve never really loved
anybody but Petrovitch. But I was sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is Petrovitch now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In America, I think, but I&rsquo;m not sure. He
never writes to me.&rdquo; She sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How are you getting on with Louise?&rdquo; Noel
asked, thinking it was time to change the subject.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see you two together!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never will,&rdquo; Connie said with feeling.
&ldquo;Eric needn&rsquo;t try to bring us together, either.
I&rsquo;ve seen her, and that&rsquo;s enough. How I hate
those thin-lipped, straw-colored women! How
Eric could have married her when he might have
married any one, I cannot imagine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People have these sudden fancies,&rdquo; said
Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about Gordon? Is it true he&rsquo;s really
engaged to Helen Dane? Not that I care much,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
as he&rsquo;s never had the politeness to come and see
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s engaged right enough. I suppose he&rsquo;s
happy. Gordon closes up like an oyster if you
touch on anything personal. We&rsquo;ve never discussed
anything in our lives. Mother&rsquo;s frightfully
pleased about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the girl like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right, but she&rsquo;s cut to pattern.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So so. Too bony, I think. But she suits Gordon.
Related to everybody, rich, correct, hasn&rsquo;t
got an original thought in her head. Thinks she&rsquo;s
literary because young Shawn Bridlington the poet
goes and reads his verses in her mother&rsquo;s drawing-room.
Affects the Bloomsbury people. Opens
bazaars and things. Jove! I&rsquo;d rather marry a
factory girl with a harelip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Much of this was Greek to his aunt, who had
the misfortune never to have heard of the Bloomsbury
people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what about Judy and that man she nearly
ran over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Noel asked innocently, not wishing to
discuss Judy and her affairs with Connie. &ldquo;What
about them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there anything in it? I hope not, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the thing&rsquo;s ridiculous. Who is he? What is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel gave an amused chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie, you really are a joy. <em>You</em> to ask
&lsquo;Who is he? What is he?&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you try to take
a leaf out of mother&rsquo;s book. It isn&rsquo;t your r&ocirc;le.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy&rsquo;s my niece, after all,&rdquo; protested Connie.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it natural that I should be interested?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Natural enough,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;I hope you
are. Ask me if he&rsquo;s a good fellow, and if I think
he could make her happy, and I&rsquo;ll be delighted
to answer you. But &lsquo;who is he?&rsquo; &hellip; that sort
of tosh.&hellip; I should think you&rsquo;d earned the
right to be human, if anybody had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered his chastened aunt. &ldquo;Is
he good enough?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s as near being good enough as
any fellow I&rsquo;ve met. If he had any money at all,
I should call it a match. But he hasn&rsquo;t, and I
don&rsquo;t know how Judy would like being downright
poor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Connie insisted, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help
wishing that my only niece would make a good
match.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel raised his eyes heavenward, despairingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For a woman who deemed the world well lost
for love.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Connie. &ldquo;But you see
Judy hasn&rsquo;t my temperament.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll refrain from saying &lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; because
it&rsquo;s your birthday,&rdquo; returned Noel. &ldquo;Here we
are, and I bet I do justice to the lunch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They both did, and Connie had occasion to congratulate
the head waiter on a very perfect
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petite
Marmite</span>. She was always at her best in restaurants.
She loved the crowds and the chatter and
the music, and the feeling that she was being
looked at, and was still worth looking at. There
was even a secret hope in her heart that people
would take Noel for her son. She liked to imagine
them saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a son who enjoys going
about with his mother.&rdquo; And Noel, who really
liked Connie and pitied her, had hopes of knocking
some sense into her foolish head in time. It
touched him, too, that she depended on him so.
</p>

<p>
Two men came in and sat at a table at Connie&rsquo;s
left, and somewhat behind her. One was fat and
old, with a round, coarse face. The other was
at least impressive, and Noel found himself watching
him. He had a dome-shaped head, rather flat
at the back, and his hair, which began high up at
the very summit of his temples was long and carefully
brushed so as to fall slightly over the collar
behind. A pair of level, frowning eyes looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
out scornfully from under projecting brows, and
the wide, thin lips protruded in a fierce pout.
Presently, when something annoyed him, he spoke
with great brusqueness to the waiter, scarcely
moving his lips as he did so.
</p>

<p>
Connie heard his voice and turned, and their
eyes met. Noel heard her draw in her breath
sharply, and for a moment she sat staring, motionless.
There was not the slightest change in the
man&rsquo;s expression, as he stared back at Connie.
There was an empty seat at his table, and suddenly
he raised a large hand with spade-shaped
fingers, and beckoned.
</p>

<p>
Connie started up from her chair like an automaton,
and would have gone to him, but Noel&rsquo;s
muscular hand closed on her wrist and fastened
it to the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep your seat!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Are you
a dog to obey that man&rsquo;s whistle? If he wants to
talk to you, let him come here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then as if ashamed of taking part in such an
intense little drama, he dropped her hand and
said lightly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend, Connie? I don&rsquo;t care for
his manners.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie strove to reach the normal again.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Petrovitch,&rdquo; she said, scarcely above a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thought so. Do you realize he beckoned to
you as though you were his slave? I&rsquo;d like to
wring his beastly neck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel! It&rsquo;s Petrovitch! What does he care
about our silly little conventions? He wants me.
I must talk to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then he can damn well come here. And for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t make a scene, Connie. Eat
your lunch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat. I haven&rsquo;t seen him for fifteen
years. Oh, Noel, I&rsquo;ve never loved any one as I&rsquo;ve
loved him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s anything to have
hysterics about. What of it? He&rsquo;ll come and
talk to you, I expect, when he&rsquo;s finished that enormous
lunch he&rsquo;s ordered. That is, if you&rsquo;re foolish
enough to wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must. Oh, Noel, have pity on me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her lips trembled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit here all day, if
you&rsquo;ll order another
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Entre C&ocirc;te</span>. Have you ever
noticed what queerly shaped heads some of these
fellows have? If I were a woman, I&rsquo;d study
phrenology a bit. That&rsquo;s where you have the best
of us. You women may&mdash;and I expect often do&mdash;possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
heads a congenital idiot would be proud
of, but we never find it out. Don&rsquo;t even show
your ears, now. It isn&rsquo;t fair. But your friend
over there&mdash;I could tell you a whole lot about him
just by looking at the back of his head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a devil if you like,&rdquo; said the unhappy
Connie, &ldquo;but I love him. And he loved me, once.
I&rsquo;d die for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neurotic,&rdquo; Noel told her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Call it what you like. I&rsquo;d rather spend five
minutes with him than a lifetime with any one
else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to spend five minutes with him myself,&rdquo;
said Noel. &ldquo;Alone. Oh,&rdquo; remembering his
empty sleeve, &ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;d wipe up the floor
with me, but I&rsquo;d tell him a few simple, home
truths first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you, Noel, ordinary rules of conduct
don&rsquo;t apply to men like Petrovitch. He&rsquo;s a genius,
a heaven-born genius. You&rsquo;ve never even heard
him play. There&rsquo;s nothing like it&mdash;there never
has been anything like it. Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s made me
suffer, but I forgive him for it, because he&rsquo;s a king
among men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A king! My good aunt, pull yourself together
and observe the way he eats asparagus.
There! I knew it &hellip; he&rsquo;s dribbled some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
melted butter down his chin and on to his waist-coat.
How would you like the job of spot-remover
to His Highness? I suppose some
wretched woman&mdash;but has he a wife? I forget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has had two,&rdquo; murmured Connie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How any woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Noel, and gave
it up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are men like that. They are unattractive
to other men perhaps, but they have an irresistible
fascination for some women. They command&mdash;we
obey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cut it, Connie!&rdquo; exclaimed Noel. &ldquo;Do you
mean to tell me that if that bounder, to satisfy
his filthy vanity, said &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; you&rsquo;d go? Like a
wretched poodle on a string. Good Lord! Where
is your pride?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only know that I must talk to him again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They finished lunch with little conversation.
Noel was angry and uncomfortable. As they
drank their coffee, and he saw that Petrovitch
too was nearing the end, he made another effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie, let&rsquo;s get out before he&rsquo;s finished. Will
you? You&rsquo;ll be glad of it all your life. I promise
you you will. It means a lot to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His earnestness had no effect. He went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always followed the line of least resistance&mdash;that&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
why you&rsquo;re what you are now.
You&rsquo;ve chucked away your life. Don&rsquo;t do it
again, Connie. You know what that man&rsquo;s opinion
of you is. He showed it pretty clearly when
he beckoned to you just now. There&rsquo;s just one
way you can hurt him&mdash;and one way you can
prove to him, and to yourself, that you&rsquo;ve got the
right stuff in you. Leave here with me, without
speaking to him. Please, Connie. Will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She wavered. Then she seized upon some
words of his, and he knew that he had lost.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurt him? I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him for anything
in the world. I want to show him that one woman
at least is faithful to him, to the end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was too much for Noel. He remembered
the French officer, Freeman, Chiozzi, and felt
sick. His impulse was to get up and leave her
then and there, but he stayed with a set jaw and
angry eyes. His hair seemed to bristle with antagonism
when Petrovitch pushed back his chair
at last and said to his companion:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pardon&mdash;a moment. I go to speak to a lady.&rdquo;
And in a second he was at their table.
</p>

<p>
Connie gave him both hands without speaking,
and he bent over them with a smile that was a
mere widening of those protruding lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie! As beautiful as ever! My dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
lady, the sight of you takes ten&mdash;fifteen years
from my age. I feel young again, and happy.
You come to my concert next week, eh? I play
for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Same old stuff!&rdquo; thought Noel.
</p>

<p>
Connie released her hands, and when she spoke
her voice was breathless and unnatural, as if she
had been running.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&hellip; I
hadn&rsquo;t seen any notices. I thought you were still
in America. This is a great surprise to me,
Illiodor.&rdquo; Then, turning to Noel, &ldquo;I want you
to meet Monsieur Petrovitch, Noel. My
nephew &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel, standing behind his chair and feeling
younger and more intolerant than he had ever
felt in his life, inclined his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh? Your nephew? Charmed.&rdquo; The great
man bowed, impressively. &ldquo;Are you too a lover
of music?&rdquo; He bent his frowning gaze upon the
young man. &ldquo;But no, you are English. So, you
will say, is the adorable aunt. But she is different.
She is of the world, eh? She loves beauty,
art, genius.&rdquo; He moved his large hands. &ldquo;Ah,
Connie, you and I had much in common. They
told me you had married again. Is it true?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I married Count Chiozzi, four years ago,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
she told him. &ldquo;My husband is in the south of
France.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Always the good cosmopolitan!&rdquo; he approved.
Then turning once more to Noel:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You also will come to my concert.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Expects me to say, &lsquo;Yes, master!&rsquo;&rdquo; thought
Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; he answered evenly and casually.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for concerts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch looked at Connie, working his prominent
brows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philistine, eh? No matter, you are one of us.
I am staying here. You will do me the honor to
dine with me to-morrow night. Good! We have
much to say to one another. Perhaps also my
friend Silberstein, eh? He is gourmet. He will
eat, you will talk to me.&rdquo; He could frown and
smile at the same time, Noel observed. &ldquo;At
eight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said the fascinated Connie.
</p>

<p>
He bent once more over her hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</span>,
my dear friend,&rdquo; he said, in his
strangely harsh voice. &ldquo;To-morrow night.&rdquo;
Then with an indifferent nod of the head in Noel&rsquo;s
direction, he returned to his table.
</p>

<p>
Connie paid the bill&mdash;she always insisted on
that&mdash;in a sort of trance, with a little excited smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
on her lips. As they got up to go out she threw
a glance at Petrovitch, and left the room, still
with that trancelike smile. It irritated Noel beyond
expression. It plainly said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not indifferent to me. He has forgotten
nothing. I shall live again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Very little was said on the way to Connie&rsquo;s
hotel. She was beyond speech for the present&mdash;she
was reliving the days when the world was
at Petrovitch&rsquo;s feet, and he, the master, was at
hers. For she believed now that it was the depth
and tumult of his passion for her that had carried
her away. She had forgotten her notes, her flowers,
the interviews she had prayed for&mdash;forgotten
all that. She won him by deliberate assault, but
once won, she became his slave, and it was as his
adoring slave in those first, brief, happy months,
that she liked to remember herself.
</p>

<p>
Noel was disgusted and annoyed. Also, he was
extremely disappointed. Was all his scolding, his
chaffing, his affection for her, the influence he had
gained, to go for nothing now? Simply because
that &hellip; brute &hellip; had turned up again? Was
there nothing he could say or do to save her?
What would Claire say? And then he asked himself,
well, what <em>would</em> Claire say? Why not find
out? That was an idea. He would find out.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come upstairs, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked
when they were in the hall of the hotel. Noel
thought her invitation somewhat perfunctory.
He suspected she wanted to be alone with her
thoughts. Nevertheless, he meant to come,
presently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be up in a minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
go on. I&rsquo;ve got to ring up somebody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lift carried her up out of his sight and he
went into the telephone booth and rang up Madame
Claire. Her telephone stood on a table
close beside her chair, and he had hardly a second
to wait before she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes? Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Noel. Where are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He told her. Then he described briefly the
luncheon at Claridge&rsquo;s and what befell there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw the announcement of his concert in last
Sunday&rsquo;s paper,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Connie never reads
the papers, or she would have seen it herself.
What is he like now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to use offensive language over
the telephone,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
He heard Madame Claire&rsquo;s laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Noel, I think the whole thing is in your
hands. You are the only one who can do anything
with her. If I say anything she will only
tell me I am
<ins title="Correct tryng to trying">trying</ins>
to rob her of her happiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
You know how she talks&mdash;such sentimental nonsense!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see that I can do anything either.
What can I do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you can do something. She knows
well enough that Petrovitch is here to-day and
gone to-morrow, while you&rsquo;re her nephew for life.
Make her choose, Noel. It will appeal to her
sense of the dramatic. You&rsquo;ll see. Make her
choose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Him or me, you mean? I believe she&rsquo;d choose
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. But try it, anyway. You&rsquo;re
so good about managing Connie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, and Noel, if she chooses you, you might
be magnanimous and offer to take her to his concert
next week. I think you could safely do that.
Good-by. I can&rsquo;t talk any more. Millie is just
coming up to see me, and she mustn&rsquo;t hear this.
Good-by and good luck!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel remained for a thoughtful moment in the
booth, and then went upstairs. Claire was quite
right. It was the only chance.
</p>

<p>
He found his troublesome aunt waiting for him
in her sitting room. She was humming softly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
looking out of the window. His indignation grew
as he looked at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;About this Petrovitch
business. I&rsquo;m pretty angry about it, as you
know perfectly well. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind that
you&rsquo;ll have to choose between me and that fellow,
and choose here and now. You can&rsquo;t have us both.
If you go out to dinner with Petrovitch to-morrow
night or any other night, or have anything further
to do with him, that&rsquo;s the end as far as I&rsquo;m
concerned. You won&rsquo;t see me again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie came swiftly back from dreams of
Petrovitch and seized Noel&rsquo;s arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel! You can&rsquo;t mean that! You can&rsquo;t mean
that you&rsquo;d drop me&mdash;have nothing more to do
with me? Oh, Noel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it and I mean it. It&rsquo;s up to you.
If you have anything more to do with that
bounder, I&rsquo;ll have nothing more to do with you.
And that&rsquo;s flat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pleaded with him. He didn&rsquo;t understand
Petrovitch. He didn&rsquo;t understand her. Ordinary
rules didn&rsquo;t apply to him because he was a
genius, nor to her because she loved him. If Noel
were older&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
That was more than he could bear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Connie. I&rsquo;m not a fool. I&rsquo;ve been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
sorry for you because you were down on your
luck; and anyway, I&rsquo;m always sorry for people
like you. And I&rsquo;m fond of you, too. But if
you&rsquo;re going to be so damn weak, and slop over
with disgusting sentiment&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie looked out of the window again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll pull up and try to make something of
your life, I&rsquo;m with you. If not, I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give him up,&rdquo; moaned Connie. &ldquo;I
want to talk over old times with him, and hear
him say that he loved me once. It means everything
to me. I must talk to him, Noel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. Then that&rsquo;s that. Well, I&rsquo;m walking
home. I feel I need a little air after all this.
It&rsquo;s good-by then, Connie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand. She turned and looked
at him wildly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel, I never thought you could be so hard!
You don&rsquo;t know how miserable you&rsquo;re making
me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Eric, too,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
forget he&rsquo;s got no love for Petrovitch. Don&rsquo;t
forget Humphries was his friend. Eric&rsquo;s
been pretty decent to you. As for &hellip; as for
Claire!&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tears welled into her eyes. Noel, who, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
many another man, found them undermining the
foundations of his wrath, softened a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sleep on it, Connie,&rdquo; he said more kindly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you until to-morrow to make up your
mind. Ring me up in the morning and let me
know what you&rsquo;ve decided to do. So long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And he turned and left her.

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack2">
&ldquo;Bless you, Claire,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">began Stephen&rsquo;s next letter,</span>
&ldquo;you make even my life worth living. Your
letters are my one delight. All the same, we are
poles apart in some things. You say, &lsquo;Oh, the joy
of wanting nothing!&rsquo; I would say, &lsquo;Oh, the misery
of wanting nothing!&rsquo; But fortunately there is
one great want that keeps my old bones above
ground, and that is the longing I have to see you
and Judy and Eric again. Of course I was a fool
not to marry. It may be fun to be a bachelor
when you&rsquo;re young, but it&rsquo;s hell when you&rsquo;re old.
I marvel at the number of women who face a life
of single cussedness voluntarily. With me, there
has been only one woman, and she holds this letter
in her hands, as she has always held the
writer&rsquo;s heart in her hands. But I&rsquo;ve known
plenty of women who would have made good
wives, and perhaps given me Judys and Erics.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you are right; I took defeat badly. My
advice, now, would always be to marry&mdash;as best
one can. There is nearly always a compromise
to be made. There would have been no compromise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
on my part, had I married you. Therefore
it was not to be, for the perfect thing is
always out of reach. Don&rsquo;t tell me your marriage
with Robert was perfect. Robert was my best
friend and I knew his faults. But he made you
happy, and that is the great thing. It ought to
be carven on a man&rsquo;s tombstone, &lsquo;He made a
woman happy.&rsquo; Well, at least, they can carve on
mine, &lsquo;He made no woman unhappy.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am feeling much better to-day, so Miss
McPherson is correspondingly gloomy. But she
is a good, devoted soul, and has borne with me
wonderfully, and I have settled something on her.
Which brings me to your last letter. If Judy and
that fellow want to marry, I will gladly settle
something on Judy. Don&rsquo;t tell her, of course.
People who really care for each other ought to be
endowed if they can&rsquo;t afford to marry. I don&rsquo;t
see the good of waiting till I&rsquo;m dead. I will do
what I should do if Judy were my daughter. You
must let me know how things go. There&rsquo;s only
my niece Monica to think of. She&rsquo;ll give what I
leave her to the Church. I don&rsquo;t mind that, for
though the Church has never done much for me&mdash;admittedly
through my own fault&mdash;it has for
other people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that brings me to a subject I approach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
with diffidence. Don&rsquo;t think me in my dotage,
Claire, if I tell you that I have become interested
in Spiritualism. I&rsquo;ve been reading a great deal,
and I have come to the unalterable conclusion
that men like Crooks, Myers, Lodge and Doyle
know what they are talking about. Some of us
take our religion on trust. Others of us want to
find out. Having floundered in a sea of agnosticism
all my life long, I now begin to feel the
ground beneath my feet. I got more out of the
&lsquo;Vital Message&rsquo; in an hour than I&rsquo;ve got out of
parsons in seventy years. I believe that if Spiritualism
were rightly understood, it would fuse all
religions and all sects. I need hardly tell you that
the Spiritualism I mean does not depend on knockings
and rappings, and the horrible fake-s?ces
of the mercenary minded. Some day I must talk
to you about this. I have said enough here, perhaps
too much; but I wanted to tell you of the
thing that has meant so much to me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I continue as well as this I may come to
London next month. London! Shall I know it,
I wonder? It will not know me. But you will,
and that is all I ask.
</p>

To this, Madame Claire made immediate
reply:

<p class="greeting"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
&ldquo;My dear Stephen,</p>
<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;Your long letter was all too short for my
liking. I feel you are really better, and I can&rsquo;t
tell you how happy that makes me. About your
coming I hardly dare to think. How good, how
good it will be! There is a brass band of sorts
playing under my window, and I wish it would
stay and play all day. That shows how happy
I am. And to that end, I am wondering whether
it would be better to pay or to refrain from paying.
I am uncritical enough at the moment to feel
that any music is good music.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How pleasant it would be if we could have
appropriate music at all crucial, or difficult, or
delightful moments in our lives! When one is
first introduced to one&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s relations, for
instance. I think Chopin would help to tide us
over that. In a bloodless battle with one&rsquo;s dressmaker
over a bill, I would recommend Tchaikowsky,
or Rimsky-Korsakov. For moments of deep
feeling, for love, we would each, I imagine, choose
something different. I think I would choose Bach,
for Bach is too great for sentiment. As for dying&mdash;every
one should die to music. I should think
young people, for instance, would choose to drift
into eternity upon the strains of the loveliest and
latest waltz. At least I have often heard them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
say they could die waltzing. There are bits of
Wagner that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind dying to. You&rsquo;ll
say dying is too serious a subject for jest. But I
can&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s any more serious than living,
which so many people are entirely frivolous about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, no, Stephen, I don&rsquo;t think you are in your
dotage. I too have read a good deal about Spiritualism,
and I believe that what these men say is
true. But I suppose I am one of those fortunate
people who have faith, and that being so I had no
need of proof. I don&rsquo;t know how my faith came
to me. I have always had it, and so don&rsquo;t deserve
any credit for it. The credit goes to people like
you, who have had to struggle all their lives
against unbelief. I believe, too, that so long as
there is a diversity of creatures on this globe, so
long will there be a diversity of religions. There
is only one God, but the roads to the understanding
of God are many.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so for you, and thousands like you, there
is Crooks, with his laboratories and his cameras
and his proofs. And for others there is Beauty.
Hear what Tagore says:
</p>

<div class="hanging-indent">
<p style="text-indent: -1.5em;">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou art the sky and Thou art also the nest.
</p>

<p>
O Thou Beautiful! How in the nest Thy love embraceth
the soul with sweet sounds and color and fragrant
odors!
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Morning cometh there, bearing in her golden basket the
wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth.
</p>

<p>
And there cometh Evening, o&rsquo;er lonely meadows deserted
of the herds, by trackless ways, carrying in her golden
pitcher cool draughts of peace from the ocean-calms
of the west.
</p>

<p>
But where Thine infinite sky spreadeth for the soul to take
her flight, a stainless white radiance reigneth; wherein
is neither day nor night, nor form nor color, nor ever
any word.&rsquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;And for others again, there is simply&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I am the Resurrection and the Life.&hellip;&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Write again soon. I long to know how you
are progressing.

<span class="firstWord">When</span>
Noel woke, the morning after his ultimatum
to Connie, he was at once aware that
something was to make that day different from
other days, but for a moment he couldn&rsquo;t remember
what that something was. Then, as the happenings
of the previous day came back to him, he
said to himself, "Connie and Petrovitch," and
sprang out of bed. He dressed quickly&mdash;for he
had reduced the business of dressing himself with
one hand to an exact science&mdash;and knocked on
Judy&rsquo;s door. He heard her call, "Come in if it&rsquo;s
Noel," and obeyed. Judy was standing before
her mirror, brushing her brown hair. Her bright
red silk dressing gown made a lovely splash of
color in the restrained little room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you up so early for?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Something on your conscience, old boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not on mine,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;Mind if I
smoke? I bet you often do before breakfast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never. You may though. You&rsquo;ve evidently
got something to tell me. Even if I am the spinster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
type, I understand the workings of the male
mind. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Connie,&rdquo; he began; then broke off
to say, &ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;ll buy you a comfortable
chair. This one&rsquo;s got a back like a pew in a
Quaker meetinghouse. However&mdash;you know yesterday
was Connie&rsquo;s birthday?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I know. Didn&rsquo;t I send her a bunch
of lilies-of-the-valley? Lilies for purity. Well,
what about it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you are also aware that she asked me
to lunch at Claridge&rsquo;s. Before we&rsquo;d been there
ten minutes, who do you suppose came in and sat
at a table almost next to ours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chiozzi?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Guess again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel, you know I hate these guessing games.
Freeman? Oh, no, he&rsquo;s dead. It was some one
to do with Connie, I suppose. Petrovitch, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No other. The dirty dog!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The plot thickens!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;What
happened then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie saw him, and nearly swooned for joy.
And then if you please, the great brute saw her
and beckoned. Beckoned, do you hear? And
she&rsquo;d have gone to him if I&rsquo;d let her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How beastly!&rdquo;
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
&ldquo;I talked to her gently but firmly, but she was
up in the air. We got through lunch somehow,
and then I tried to persuade her to get out before
he could speak to her. But she wouldn&rsquo;t budge.
He didn&rsquo;t move either until he&rsquo;d almost finished
feeding. Then he came to our table. I wish you
could have seen Connie registering soulfulness. I
can tell you, a close-up of both of them would
have been pleasing to a screen audience. After
twenty years the villain sees the heroine again.
Tableau!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Well, go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We exchanged a pleasantry or two, and then
he commanded Connie to dine with him to-night.
Connie of course was writhing on the mat for pure
joy, and barking short, happy barks. She licked
his hand and meekly indicated that his lightest
wish was her law. Then we went. I wasn&rsquo;t feeling
full of love for human nature by that time, I
can tell you. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so I rang
up Claire and she advised me to issue an ultimatum.
Which I did. I said that if she spoke to
Petrovitch again, all was over between us. Sob
stuff from Connie. I really was sorry for her. In
the end I told her to sleep on it, and to ring me
up in the morning. Then I left her. Do you
think I did right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Judy considered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would half kill her not to see you again.
She adores you, you know. But I think Claire
was right. If that won&rsquo;t pull her up, nothing will.
What do you think she&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll dine with Petrovitch, all right,&rdquo;
prophesied Noel gloomily. &ldquo;Hang it all! I
thought she&rsquo;d learned something. I didn&rsquo;t expect
her to change her nature all at once, but I did
think she&rsquo;d begun to see the silliness of that sort
of behavior.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The way of the reformer is hard,&rdquo; said his
sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not trying to reform her. I only
wanted to show her that she&rsquo;d get more out of
life if she tried another tack. And I believe she
was beginning to see it, too. If only that&mdash;swine
hadn&rsquo;t come along!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, stick to your guns,&rdquo; advised Judy. &ldquo;I
have a feeling that she&rsquo;ll come round. But, Noel,
if she doesn&rsquo;t come round?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. If she doesn&rsquo;t, ought I to keep my
threat? After all, perhaps I&rsquo;ve no right &hellip;
I suppose it&rsquo;s difficult &hellip; if I thought it would
cure her to see him a few times, I&rsquo;d let her. But
he&rsquo;s her hero for life, spots and all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Spots?&rdquo; Judy paused with upraised arms.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
&ldquo;Any number of &rsquo;em. On his clothes. A dirty
feeder. As for his hair!&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer, Noel? That sort of thing? I
can&rsquo;t understand it, can you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
thought of kidnapping Connie and shutting her
up somewhere till he goes. He&rsquo;ll only be here a
week or so. I saw it in the paper last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy laughed as she pinned her hair into place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor old Connie! She&rsquo;s sure to do the wrong
thing, I suppose. She always has. But there&rsquo;s
just a chance. She&rsquo;s so fond of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather fond of her. She&rsquo;s a good sort,
really, under all this Camille business. She
doesn&rsquo;t understand you though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can bear that,&rdquo; replied his sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; remarked Noel, remembering
her comments on the subject of Judy and
Chip, &ldquo;but I believe that if Connie hadn&rsquo;t been
&hellip; what she is &hellip; she&rsquo;d have been a terribly
conventional woman. I think she&rsquo;s a sort of
Millie-gone-wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This amused Judy greatly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If only mother could hear you say that!&rdquo; she
said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on to-night?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Anything
doing here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
&ldquo;Have you forgotten? Major Crosby&rsquo;s coming
to dinner, and we promised to give him a dancing
lesson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chip! So he is! This bother about Connie
put it out of my head for the moment. What
shall I do if she asks me to take her out to dinner?
As she may do, if she decides not to see
Petrovitch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I suppose you must take her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We might dine early and come here after,&rdquo;
he suggested. &ldquo;Would mother object, do you
think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mother
has only seen her once since she came back, and
then she went to her hotel heavily veiled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel nodded appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll ask her. There&rsquo;s no harm in Connie,
poor old thing. Will Gordon be home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Helen&rsquo;s dining here too. I didn&rsquo;t want
her a bit to-night. She&rsquo;s so&mdash;patronizing. Not
to me, but to strangers. And Chip will be shyer
than ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, remember,&rdquo; Noel cautioned her, &ldquo;Chip&rsquo;s
<em>my</em> friend. We met at the Club. It was only
a few yards away, so that isn&rsquo;t much of a fib.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve given out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather dreading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
to-night, really. I&rsquo;d like to have kept Chip
to ourselves, if we could. But I suppose it
wouldn&rsquo;t have done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gong boomed loudly, and Judy flew to get
a dress out of her wardrobe.
</p>

<p>
When they met at breakfast a few minutes
later, they said good morning as though they
hadn&rsquo;t seen each other before. In the midst of
their family, the brother and sister had from
childhood maintained a sort of Secret Society.
Their two minds, critical and inquiring from the
first, had early found themselves in tune with
each other and out of tune with the rest. When
Judy looked back on her childhood and girlhood,
it always seemed to her to be streaked with light
and dark spots. The light spots were Noel&rsquo;s
vacations, and the times when they were together,
and the dark spots were the long school terms,
and&mdash;darkest spot of all&mdash;his absence at the war.
But even as a child the joy of having him with
her was always faintly shadowed by the fear of
some day not having him. For years she had
said to herself:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I could only love some one else as much
as I do Noel, then fate would have a choice of
two marks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And if the other members of the family objected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
to the brother and sister&rsquo;s marked preference
for each other&rsquo;s society, they kept it to themselves
remarkably well.
</p>

<p>
The Pendletons always had family prayers.
Mrs. Pendleton insisted on them less from conviction
than for the reason that all the other
Pendletons had them, and she believed they had
a good effect on the servants. So the entire household
assembled in the dining room at a quarter
to nine, and if any one was late, he or she was
waited for. This morning Gordon was late, but
when he was the offender, nothing was said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton officiated. He was a little man,
with what the Pendletons chose to call a handsome
nose. Most people thought it merely large.
His face barely escaped being intellectual, but
something narrow about the forehead and peevish
about the mouth, spoiled the effect. Noel looked
the most like him, but Noel&rsquo;s forehead and mouth
had what his father&rsquo;s lacked. Fortunately he
took after his mother in the matter of height,
for Millie was a good five inches taller than her
husband. In her large, charmless way she was
handsome, and had regular and uninteresting
features. It was difficult to see in Judy the least
trace of likeness to either of her parents, while
Gordon, on the contrary, was the image of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
mother, and she idolized him. She was prepared,
too, to find in Helen, when she became his wife,
all that she found lacking in Judy.
</p>

<p>
Prayers over, breakfast immediately followed.
It was usually a quiet meal, enlivened only by
excursions after food, and the rustle of newspapers.
But this morning there was an uncommon
amount of talk. It went as follows:
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;Gordon, I hope you haven&rsquo;t
forgotten you are lunching with Sir William to-day
at his club.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;No, father. I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten.
Won&rsquo;t you be there too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;Unfortunately, it is not possible.
I have a very trying day ahead of me.&rdquo;
(Mr. Pendleton was a barrister, but his large
income made work less a necessity than a hobby.)
</p>

<p>
Millie: &ldquo;I shall be glad when the summer
comes, John, and you can take a holiday. By
the way, I wish you&rsquo;d all make up your minds
where you want to go this year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;Must we decide six months ahead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millie: &ldquo;We always have done so. I like to
know in good time what I&rsquo;m going to do. We
could go abroad, I suppose, but your father thinks
we ought to go to Scotland as usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Judy: &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we all go where we like?
Must we have a holiday
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;You can hardly speak of a
small party of five as going
&lsquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be one of the party, so it&rsquo;s
only four. You know, Mother, Helen and I will
be at Ottway Castle for July and August.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millie: &ldquo;Of course, dear. I know you are provided
for. It&rsquo;s Judy and Noel I was thinking of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy: &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you and father go to
Scotland, and let Noel and me go somewhere else&mdash;Devon
or Cornwall for a change. It&rsquo;s so dull
doing the same thing every year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;I think we will all go together
as usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(Silence.)
</p>

<p>
Judy: &ldquo;Then why ask us to make up our minds
where we want to go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;Your mother asked. Personally,
I am convinced that Scotland is the most
bracing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy: &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t feel I want to be braced.
Do you, Noel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;I loathe bracing places.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;Then let us all go to Cornwall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millie: &ldquo;I find Cornwall so relaxing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Judy: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like just to stay in Sussex
with Claire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton: &ldquo;You know, Judy, I dislike
very much hearing you speak of your grandmother
as Claire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy: &ldquo;Sorry, father. I forgot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(Silence.)
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;By the way, mother, I&rsquo;ve got rather
a good idea. I may be taking Con&mdash;Aunt Connie
out to dinner to-night. Suppose I bring her here
afterwards? It would cheer her up a lot. I know
she likes seeing people dance. You wouldn&rsquo;t mind,
would you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;Noel, you really are a bit of an ass
sometimes! You know Helen&rsquo;s coming here to-night.
How could I possibly ask her to meet
Aunt Connie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know why not, you
ought to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;Chuck it, Gordon! Don&rsquo;t be such a
prig. What about Helen&rsquo;s friend, Oriana Temple?
If Connie can teach her anything!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;Please leave Helen and her friends
out of the discussion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;Right. But you brought her in. Anyhow,
I asked mother. Mother, you don&rsquo;t mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
if Connie comes here to-night, do you? After
all, she&rsquo;s your sister, and it would be doing her
a kindness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millie: &ldquo;Gordon is quite right, Noel. There
is no reason why we should inflict our family
skeleton on Helen. If Connie is an unhappy
woman, it&rsquo;s entirely her own fault. She has forfeited
the right to be with decent people. Don&rsquo;t
you agree with me, John?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pendleton (unexpectedly): &ldquo;I think, my
dear, that if we can help Connie, we ought to
do so. I feel she has a claim upon us, and as
Christian people we have no right to ignore it.
<ins title="Change Is to It">It</ins>
isn&rsquo;t as though the children were growing up;
and after all, Gordon, Helen is marrying into
our family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel: &ldquo;Good for you, dad!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;Let her come by all means. Helen
and I will dine here another night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millie: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very tiresome of you, Noel, to
upset everything like this. And while we&rsquo;re on
the subject of Aunt Connie, I want to say that
I don&rsquo;t mind your being polite to her, but I do
not like your going about with her so much. If
you had to ask her here, some other night would
have done as well. I&rsquo;m certain your friend Major
Crosby won&rsquo;t want to meet her.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Noel: &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t mind. Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t
know anything about her. And I had a particular
reason for wanting to bring her to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled, then. Helen and I
will dine here to-morrow night, mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy and Noel were amazed at the stand their
father had taken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never thought dad had it in him,&rdquo; Noel
said later.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Influence of morning prayers,&rdquo; answered Judy.
&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s always nicest just after prayers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At ten o&rsquo;clock the maid sought out Noel with
the message that Countess Chiozzi was on the
telephone and would like to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I lose, I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; said Noel to Judy as he left
the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, Connie!&rdquo; he began cheerfully. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
my aunt this morning? Feeling better? Good!
I was rather a beast yesterday, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you were,&rdquo; a rather dejected voice replied.
&ldquo;I hardly slept a wink all night. Noel,
it&rsquo;s &hellip; it&rsquo;s breaking my heart, but I know I
can&rsquo;t give <em>you</em> up. There&rsquo;s no use.&hellip; I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right you are! You don&rsquo;t have to. Tell you
what&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go for a bean-o to-night. I&rsquo;ll dine
you at a new place I wot of, and then I&rsquo;ll bring
you back here. There&rsquo;ll be just the family, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Major Crosby, and perhaps one or two others.
Oh, and I&rsquo;ll teach you to dance. What do you
say? Nothing like dancing to keep you young.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connie hesitated, then said rather dubiously:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But nobody wants me there. Does Millie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just you come along and see. I&rsquo;ll call for you
at seven. Make yourself beautiful. The gray
chiffon, with pearls&mdash;what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that? Very well. Noel, I shall be dreadfully
nervous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nervous! Nonsense, Countess! Pull up your
socks. And, by the way, Connie, a light hand
with the make-up. I&rsquo;ll inspect you at seven. And&mdash;oh,
one thing more. How would you like me
to take you to What&rsquo;s-His-Name&rsquo;s concert next
Friday? You can feast your eyes and ears on him
then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <em>are</em> generous, Noel! It would mean
everything to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get seats, then. You&rsquo;re a sport, Connie.
So long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He left the telephone, whistling jubilantly, and
went to tell Judy the news. Then he told his
mother, who was less pleased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a piece of impertinence, her coming to
London at all. I don&rsquo;t know what your grandmother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
could have been thinking of. I won&rsquo;t
object to her coming this once, but it mustn&rsquo;t
happen again. We owe it to Gordon to keep her
in the background.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel left it at that. He never argued with his
mother.
</p>

<p>
Gordon had reckoned without his Helen, who
prided herself on being modern. When he told
her he would rather she dined there the following
night, she wanted to know the reason.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not that beautiful Mrs. Humphries who ran
off with Petrovitch? I&rsquo;d quite forgotten she was
your aunt. What nonsense, Gordon! Of course
I shall come. As if her past made the slightest
difference to me! I hear she&rsquo;s still quite lovely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gordon reported this new development to his
mother in his own way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s been awfully nice about it,&rdquo; Millie
told her husband later. &ldquo;She told Gordon she
didn&rsquo;t mind meeting Connie at all, and that as
she was marrying into the family she intended
taking the rough with the smooth. She&rsquo;s such a
sensible girl!&rdquo;
</p>

        </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Judy</span>
had neither seen nor heard from Major
Crosby since the day they had tea together at
Madame Claire&rsquo;s. She had written him a note
to thank him for his flowers, the sending of which
had both pleased and touched her. Knowing his
poverty and his reserve, she read into his gift,
more, perhaps, than he had intended she should.
Chip looked upon the sending of flowers as the
natural tribute to be paid to any charming woman,
and imagined in his simplicity, that she must
receive very many such gifts. She guessed this,
but at the same time she also guessed that never
before in his life, probably, had he sent flowers
to a woman. Pink roses, too.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
She wondered about him a good deal&mdash;wondered
what he did with himself evenings, and
where and how he spent his Sundays. Like Madame
Claire, she felt that Chip was a man not
marked for success, but at least she was determined
that, whatever happened, his life should be
less empty and colorless because of that accident
in the fog.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
On the whole, however, she dreaded the evening
for him. She felt that he would be neither
amused nor benefited by it. She knew she would
get little help from her mother, and as for Gordon
and Helen, they never bothered with people unless
they mattered.
</p>

<p>
Once more, Helen had not been reckoned with.
She sat next to Chip at table, and soon saw that
he had eyes only for her future sister-in-law&mdash;and
a tongue only for her too, it seemed. Helen
decided to be bored at first, but as she was slightly
annoyed with Gordon, who sat on her left, she
presently turned her batteries full on the surprised
Chip, who had no idea he was neglecting his neighbor.
Helen could be very charming when the
spirit moved her. After inviting him to her house
to meet a writer whose work he admired, she went
on to what she had learned was his chief interest.
That she lowered her voice to discuss.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A tremendously important subject &hellip; we
moderns want to know &hellip; made rather a study
of these things myself &hellip; esoteric beliefs &hellip;&rdquo;
were scraps that Judy&rsquo;s ears couldn&rsquo;t ignore. And
later, &ldquo;I do wish we&rsquo;d met before. Why is it
that people who do things that are worth while
are always so hard to get at? One has to hunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
them out of their holes, as,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;I
mean to hunt you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chip made some appropriate answer to this,
and Helen was about to continue her attack when
Millie cut in with:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it the Crosbys of Crosby Steynes, or the
Crosbys of Middle Regis you&rsquo;re related to,
Major Crosby? They&rsquo;re both such delightful
people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Chip was lost to the rest of the table for
a good ten minutes while he and Millie dived
together into a sea of relationships. At the end
of it, Millie came to the surface with nothing
better in the way of a catch than some entirely
unclassified Crosbys who lived somewhere near
Aberdeen. The ladies then departed to the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Left alone with Mr. Pendleton, Gordon and
a friend of his, a Captain Stevens from the Foreign
Office, Chip did some classifying on his own
account. Gordon, he decided, was a young man
who had much to learn, but the chances were that
he would never learn it. He liked Mr. Pendleton,
who was determined to be a pleasant host.
As for Captain Stevens, he thought him a nice
fellow, in spite of his admission that he spent his
nights dancing. He wondered at first if perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Judy&mdash;but five minutes&rsquo; conversation with the
young man convinced him that he wasn&rsquo;t Judy&rsquo;s
sort. He missed Noel, with his easy manners,
and his human touch.
</p>

<p>
When they went up to the drawing-room, which
was cleared for dancing, he went straight to Judy,
and sat beside her on a settee, thus defeating Captain
Stevens, who had intended doing the same
thing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this where I begin?&rdquo; asked Chip, looking
fearfully at the satiny floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering
that myself. Suppose we let the young people
dance to-night?&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Somehow I
haven&rsquo;t the heart to make you. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll
hate it, after all, and I&rsquo;m not a bit in the mood for
it myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think me a coward,&rdquo; Chip
told her, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d be ever so much happier if I
could stay just where I am. Perhaps I could
learn something by watching Captain Stevens. I
expect he dances like a wave of the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s marvelous,&rdquo; agreed Judy. &ldquo;Hundreds
of maidens have tried to marry him for his
dancing, but I understand he&rsquo;s never yet met his
equal and won&rsquo;t wed until he does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chip shook his head.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
&ldquo;I feel like Rip Van Winkle. I believe several
generations have gone by without my noticing it.
But I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to learn something
about this one. When do your brother and Miss
Dane expect to be married?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In June. How do you like Helen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was very kind. I shouldn&rsquo;t say it, perhaps,
but wasn&rsquo;t there something of the Lady
Bountiful about it all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Helen likes patronizing the arts. The arts
are very fashionable just now in her set. I like
Helen, really. If only she and her friends weren&rsquo;t
so fond of posing&mdash;and they find new poses every
year&mdash;one would like them better. But it
isn&rsquo;t as if Noel were marrying her. Gordon has
always seemed to belong to other people&rsquo;s families
more than to his own, and now of course he&rsquo;ll
be entirely absorbed by Lord Ottway&rsquo;s, and their
friends and relations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bit like your brother Noel. I think
Noel is one of the most attractive young men I
ever met. He has such a way of making one feel
his friend at once.&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s no one like him,&rdquo; said Judy,
delighted at this praise, &ldquo;but Gordon&rsquo;s the one
who&rsquo;ll succeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah, very likely. Success.&hellip; I wonder
which is worse; to ignore it, or to bow down to
it? I&rsquo;ve ignored it all my life. I&rsquo;ve never thought
about it. And now I&rsquo;ve suddenly discovered that
I want it. Yes, I want it badly. And I&rsquo;m wondering
if it&rsquo;s too late &hellip; if it won&rsquo;t, perhaps,
ignore me, now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His eyes met hers, frankly. What he meant
was that without success he felt he could not
enjoy her friendship. At least he thought he
meant that. Judy thought he meant something
quite different.
</p>

<p>
Then Noel came in with Connie, and that ended
their talk for the present. Connie was looking
wonderfully young and extremely handsome, and
was no more made up than was permissible. Her
lovely gray gown and her triple row of pearls&mdash;Morton
Freeman&rsquo;s gift&mdash;became her to perfection.
She looked a different woman from the
painted, haggard creature Eric had first seen in
Paris. Millie&rsquo;s greeting was formal, while Mr.
Pendleton&rsquo;s&mdash;he had expected something so very
much worse&mdash;was almost effusive. A look from
Millie, however, soon put him in his place, which,
for the rest of the evening, was the smoking room.
Chip was talking to Noel, and Judy was just
beginning to feel that the evening might not be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
fiasco after all, when Helen, assured and smiling,
bore down upon Chip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s good dancing material, unless I&rsquo;m much
mistaken,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Any one who appreciates
poetry must have a sense of rhythm, and if you
have that, you can dance.&rdquo; So she led him protesting
helplessly, to the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bother Helen,&rdquo; said Judy under her breath.
&ldquo;If he ever did learn to dance, I intended teaching
him myself.&rdquo; She felt a little ruffled, although
she realized perfectly that Helen&rsquo;s attentions to
Chip were probably occasioned by some little tiff
with Gordon.
</p>

<p>
As she danced with Captain Stevens, she
watched Chip, and saw that he was acquitting
himself creditably. But it seemed to her all
wrong that he should be dancing at all. It didn&rsquo;t
suit him. He wasn&rsquo;t a dancing man and never
would be. She was glad of it. There were plenty
of Captain Stevens&rsquo; sort about. She suddenly
felt a distaste for that form of amusement. In
the midst of the moving couples, and the raucous
voice of the gramophone, a wave of distaste and
boredom came over her. What was she doing
with her life? Nothing. It was empty, useless,
senseless. She wasn&rsquo;t wanted anywhere. And
now she was trying to drag Chip into that emptiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
To what end? To be told by Helen how
to point his toes? Better have left him with his
books. He was too good for that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
If Chip wanted her, she would marry him.
She liked everything about him&mdash;even his oddly
cut evening clothes, that reminded her of Du
Maurier&rsquo;s drawings. She caught his eyes just
then, and there was a rather pleading look in
them. He evidently wasn&rsquo;t enjoying his lesson.
Well, the gramophone would run down in a minute,
and then they could all stop. She hadn&rsquo;t
spoken a word to Captain Stevens, who, fortunately,
thought she was so thrilled by the perfection
of his dancing that she didn&rsquo;t want to spoil
a perfect moment by speaking.
</p>

<p>
She tried to picture herself married to Chip.
It would mean managing on nothing a year in
that tiny flat, or one like it. To-night she was
sure she wouldn&rsquo;t mind. It would take them
months&mdash;years perhaps, to know each other well.
It would be such fun finding out. And being
modern and willing to face facts, she tried to picture
herself wheeling a perambulator about Campden
Hill on the nurse&rsquo;s day out. By that time
Chip would have had a great success with his book
on religions or some other book, and they would
have a house. Yes, poverty and all, if Chip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
wanted her, she would marry him. Only Noel
was right. She would have to be bold.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
The gramophone ran down and the dancing
stopped. Captain Stevens, full of enthusiasm,
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was glorious! We must have another
fox-trot.&rdquo; And went to put on another record.
</p>

<p>
Judy made her way to where Connie was sitting,
and on hearing her say she had not yet met
Helen, she introduced them. Helen, who had
already decided she wouldn&rsquo;t be above asking
Connie&rsquo;s advice about her trousseau, sat beside
her and talked about Cannes and Monte Carlo,
while Gordon, who had greeted his aunt with
extreme coldness, stood a few feet away and
impersonated a young man in the sulks. Judy was
about to go to him, when the maid appeared in
the doorway, and Judy, seeing that she had something
to say to her, crossed the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted on the telephone, Miss Judy,&rdquo;
said the maid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dawson, and she wants to
speak to you most particularly, Miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dawson!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t
mean &hellip;&rdquo; but without finishing her sentence she
ran to the telephone, which was downstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that you, Miss Judy?&rdquo; asked Dawson.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a little upset here to-night. A telegram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
came from Miss McPherson about Mr. de Lisle,
and it seems the poor gentleman&rsquo;s quite ill, and
wants to see you or Mr. Eric. We&rsquo;ve rung up
Mr. Eric, and he says he can&rsquo;t possibly get away
this week. So we wondered if you could go, Miss.
It would mean leaving at once, Miss Judy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy didn&rsquo;t hesitate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll go. Tell Madame Claire I&rsquo;ll
go to-morrow. Is she in bed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is, Miss. The telegram should have come
two hours ago, but it was sent to the wrong room.
We do think, Miss, that it would be better in a
way for Mr. Eric to go, but we don&rsquo;t like to take
any risks, in case the old gentleman&rsquo;s very ill
indeed. And it&rsquo;s out of the question for us to go
ourselves, Miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But of course I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; Judy repeated. &ldquo;Dawson,
tell Madame Claire not to worry, and that
I&rsquo;ll be off the very minute I can get a passport.
I&rsquo;m so sorry for poor old Mr. de Lisle. Is Madame
Claire very much upset?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, not what you&rsquo;d call upset,&rdquo; Dawson replied.
&ldquo;We do keep calm, Miss, whatever happens.
But it is sad, the time being so near when
he hoped to come to England.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come yet, I feel sure. I&rsquo;ll send a wire
to-morrow to say I&rsquo;m leaving. I&rsquo;ll probably come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
in the morning for a minute to say good-by. Give
Madame Claire my love, and tell her the trip will
be a godsend to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She went straight to her mother with the news.
Millie was thoroughly annoyed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think your grandmother has taken leave of
her senses,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;First Connie and now
this. You can&rsquo;t possibly go to Cannes alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
treat me as though I were a child or an imbecile.
You know perfectly well I can go&mdash;and must go.
If you and father won&rsquo;t help me, Claire will pay
my expenses. I know she&rsquo;ll offer to, anyway.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had better speak to your father,&rdquo; said
Millie with chilling disapproval.
</p>

<p>
It was undoubtedly one of Mr. Pendleton&rsquo;s best
days. He looked almost indulgently at his handsome,
excited daughter, and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Judith, I can see you&rsquo;re bent on going.
I suppose you&rsquo;ll find friends there. You might
arrange to come back with some of them. My
only fear is that the old man will die, and that
would be very awkward for you. They make a
considerable to-do in France, when people die.
Still, I suppose if your grandmother wants
it &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Considerably later, she found herself alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
with Chip again. He had been danced with twice
by Helen, and felt that he had earned a respite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long do you think you&rsquo;ll be gone?&rdquo; he
asked, on hearing the news.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that depends on Mr. de Lisle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he Stephen de Lisle? The man who
was &hellip; what was it? &hellip; Home Secretary, I
think. A good many years ago. And I seem to
remember some tremendous quarrel, with the then
Prime Minister. A man with a very fine head. I
remember his pictures quite well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Old Stephen. He was a great, great
friend of mine when I was seven, and I haven&rsquo;t
seen him since. But he&rsquo;s always been in love
with Madame Claire&mdash;since before she married
my grandfather. People of their generation did
that sort of thing&mdash;loved for a lifetime. I wonder
why nobody does now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certain of it. The thing to do nowadays is
to console oneself as quickly as possible. And
I think there is a good deal of prejudice against
wasting lives, and wasted lives. And rightly, too,
I suppose.&rdquo; Then, changing the subject: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
away for several weeks, and I wish you&rsquo;d write
to me and let me know if the headaches have
stopped, and how you&rsquo;re getting on, generally. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
shall be at the Riviera Hotel, in Cannes, where
Old Stephen is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I write? But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find my
letters very dull. I see so few people. I suppose,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;I ought to have had more to
do with people. Only, when a man has nothing
whatever to offer, he is apt to retire into his shell.
I did, and I should have remained there, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for you.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promise me, then,&rdquo; she said, looking at him
seriously, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t slip back into it again
the moment my back is turned. I&rsquo;d like you to see
something of Madame Claire, and of Noel. They
both like you, you know, and will want to see
you. Will you promise me that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything you think is good for me,&rdquo;
he answered, smiling. Then he too looked serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Pendleton, you don&rsquo;t know what it means
to a man to feel himself tied by the lack of money.
I suppose another man in my place would have
found some way of making it. No doubt I should
have chucked writing long ago, or tried to write
something more lucrative than a book on religion.
But, on the other hand, should I? If I have written
something of any value, if the book is well
received, I shall feel justified in having spent so
many years on it. If it isn&rsquo;t? Well, I don&rsquo;t know.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have the heart to launch out into
business, at forty-four. But I hardly expect you
to understand that. You&rsquo;re young and happy.
You have everything in front of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Did you say happy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked quickly at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She met his eyes squarely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If a rat in a trap or a squirrel in a cage is
happy, then perhaps I am. I hate the life I&rsquo;m
living. Yes, I do, I hate it. If it weren&rsquo;t for
Noel and Madame Claire, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what I&rsquo;d do. Something pretty desperate, just
to get away from it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat looking at her as if he couldn&rsquo;t trust his
own senses. She couldn&rsquo;t be serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sentimentalist,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You
believe what you like to believe. I suppose you&rsquo;ve
imagined all sorts of pretty things about me. I
assure you, that rather than go on living as I&rsquo;ve
been living, I&rsquo;d change places with the between-maid
in our kitchen. It wasn&rsquo;t so bad during the
war. I did nursing then. But now, because I&rsquo;m
the only daughter, mother and father won&rsquo;t
hear of my taking up any sort of work. I go once
a week to Bermondsy to teach a class of girls
hat-trimming, and even that&rsquo;s frowned upon because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
I once got measles there. No, I&rsquo;m expected
to sit with folded hands until some young man
comes along and marries me. Isn&rsquo;t it extraordinary,
in this day and age?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chip was still speechless.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go on like this till I die, I suppose,
or marry somebody out of sheer boredom. And
I keep asking myself what I ought to do. What
would some one else do in my place? Should I
simply walk out of the house, and try to live my
own life? But where would I go, and what would
I do? I&rsquo;ve no training except nursing, and I
should hate ordinary, peace-time nursing. And
would it be fair to my family, who after all have
spent a great deal of money on me? And each
year I think, &lsquo;Next year is sure to be different,&rsquo;
but it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s exactly the same, or worse, and
I&rsquo;m a year older and have accomplished nothing.
If it had been my lot to live in the country, I
expect I would have hunted, or perhaps kept a
lot of dogs, or looked after a garden. But as
it is &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She broke off. Captain Stevens descended on
them to ask her to dance again, but she shook
her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit in the mood for it to-night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Look, the Winslow girls have just come. They&rsquo;re
heavenly dancers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Captain Stevens went, after a curious glance
at Chip. Who was the fellow in the antiquated
evening clothes, who was so quiet at dinner? A
&ldquo;oner&rdquo; with the ladies, at any rate.
</p>

<p>
Judy turned once more to Chip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been perfectly beastly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
I feel better for it. And if I&rsquo;ve destroyed a lot
of your illusions, I&rsquo;m sorry, but at least you know
more of Judy Pendleton than you did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What you have told me,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;has made me feel very sad, for your sake. I
was so sure you were happy. But for my own
sake &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know &hellip; I think it has made
you seem less terribly remote. I felt before that
we were in different hemispheres. Now &hellip;
well, we at least inhabit the same imperfect planet.
And it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing for me to know any
one like you. To-night has been &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad if you haven&rsquo;t minded it. I was
afraid you&rsquo;d hate it, or at least be bored.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bored?&rdquo; He smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I must have made friends when I
was young,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I remember imagining
myself in love once or twice, and I was exactly
like any other young man, no doubt. Then I
went out to South Africa, and after the war I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
came home to find my mother dead. I was very
ill for a long time, and I got out of the habit of
seeing people. Then, when my health improved,
I began to write. Articles; all sorts of things.
Then I was sent out to India to join my regiment,
and while I was there I began the book on religions,
but for some years I hardly did more than
make a beginning. But at last I got so interested
in it that when I returned from India I left the
army and went to live in a lonely cottage in Cornwall
that belonged to my mother. I suppose I
allowed the book to become an obsession, as Lady
Gregory said, for I spent weeks&mdash;months sometimes&mdash;without
seeing a soul except the village
people, and Major Stroud now and then. Then
the war came, and until 1919 I was in France.
When I came home, I took the flat in Campden
Hill. The night &hellip; the night of the accident,
Major Stroud had dragged me out to dine at his
club. I remember he had been lecturing me for
being such a hermit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And rightly,&rdquo; said Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still, I should have gone on being a hermit,
if you hadn&rsquo;t come just when you did.&rdquo; He
paused. &ldquo;And yet there are people who deny
that there&rsquo;s a benevolent Deity who orders our
lives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Captain Stevens might have said that and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
meant nothing by it, and if he had said it, Judy
would have had a retort ready. But coming from
Chip, it could not be treated so lightly. How
much, she wondered, did he mean? Oh, he meant
what he said, of course, but how much did he
mean her to understand by it? And then she
realized that had he meant to express more than
an appreciation of her friendship, he could never
have said it so easily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope your Deity will take an interest
in the book,&rdquo; she said, and then was suddenly
aware that she had spent the greater part of the
evening talking to Chip. She looked about her.
Helen and Gordon were dancing. Connie had
boldly taken the floor with Noel a few minutes
previously, but was now watching him dance with
one of the Winslow girls, and Captain Stevens
was dancing with the other. Millie was nowhere
to be seen. Not for a moment must Connie be
allowed to regret that she hadn&rsquo;t dined with
Petrovitch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and help me amuse my aunt,&rdquo; said Judy.
Then, with a sparkle in her eyes, &ldquo;And if you
can think of any pretty speeches to make her
such as you have just made me, so much the
better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">&ldquo;It</span>
won&rsquo;t be wildly gay,&rdquo; said Noel as he saw
Judy off at Victoria Station two days later, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ll have sun and a change of scene. Anyhow,
I have a pretty good hunch that the old boy&rsquo;s
going to get better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy was talking to him through the window,
feeling like anybody in the world but Judy Pendleton.
She, of all people, to be going to Cannes;
and alone! Well, nothing ever happened but
the unexpected, and this was the unexpected in
one of its pleasantest forms. And if only Noel
should prove to be right about his &ldquo;hunch&rdquo;!&hellip;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He must get better! I should so love to see
him and Claire hobnobbing together. Write to
me at least every other day, won&rsquo;t you? And
tell me all about Connie and Petrovitch&mdash;only I
hope there won&rsquo;t be much to tell&mdash;and Eric and
Louise, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Find out what the family
thought of Chip. I&rsquo;m longing to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
As the train moved off, he walked beside it for
a few feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, by the way, I think I&rsquo;ve got a job.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me sooner? What
is it? Quick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write,&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Not positive yet.
Good-by!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that means going away,&rdquo;
thought Judy, as she arranged herself and her
belongings. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me
sooner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The thought of it sent her spirits down considerably,
but she made up her mind not to borrow
trouble. If he hadn&rsquo;t spoken of it before,
it was because he wasn&rsquo;t sure. Life without Noel
would be &hellip; no, it didn&rsquo;t bear thinking of. Time
enough to worry when she heard from him.
Wasn&rsquo;t she on her way to the Riviera, for the
first time? The word had always been a magical
one, to her. It meant color, warmth, life. She
would see the Mediterranean. And it was her
first adventure. Mr. Pendleton had most unexpectedly
presented her with fifty pounds, telling
her to buy herself some dresses in Cannes. It was
very nearly a fortune. Madame Claire herself
was paying for the trip, and had given her a little
money to gamble with.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
&ldquo;For of course you must play,&rdquo; she had said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure to find friends there; and even if
Stephen dies&mdash;which Heaven forbid!&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
see why you shouldn&rsquo;t stay on for a little and
enjoy yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next day the sight of Marseilles, golden
in the sunshine, made her forget every trouble,
past and to come. She had an impression of old
houses with greeny-blue shutters, and bare plane
trees, the twisted limbs of which looked white
and strange in the sunlight. And beyond, the
incredibly blue water. She could hardly keep her
delight to herself as the train wound its leisurely
way along the lovely, broken coast. She gloried
in the greeny-gray of the olive trees, in the rich,
red earth, in the burning blue of sea and sky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to live here,&rdquo; she thought, as
they passed some blue-shuttered house behind its
vines and its fig trees. Or, &ldquo;no, here!&rdquo; as another
even more alluring showed itself among its terraced
olive groves. She thought, with commiseration,
of her parents who might have been there
too had they cared to make the effort, stuffily
going their rounds&mdash;&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as though they
couldn&rsquo;t afford it,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I believe
it&rsquo;s because they want to save for Gordon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss McPherson, a little, calm, thin-lipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Scotch woman, met her at the station in Cannes.
She seemed glad, in her quiet, professional way,
to see Judy, and as they drove to the hotel in the
omnibus, she told her about Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a slight stroke,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;but
we won&rsquo;t be calling it that because Mr. de Lisle
doesn&rsquo;t know, or doesn&rsquo;t want to know. He will
have it that it was an attack of some sort. But
he&rsquo;s much better to-day, and in a fortnight or so,
he&rsquo;ll be as well as he was before. Of course that
isn&rsquo;t saying that he&rsquo;ll be enjoying robust health.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean that he can never come to
London?&rdquo; Judy asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear me, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. You&rsquo;ll
do him good. And I think he&rsquo;s been here long
enough.&rdquo; Then she added with a twinkle in her
little gray eyes:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was just determined to see you or Colonel
Gregory. Between you and me, Miss Pendleton,
my poor old patient&rsquo;s very bored here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than ever glad
that I came. I&rsquo;m thankful to hear he&rsquo;s no worse;
I was afraid of&mdash;something really desperate.
We must amuse him somehow. Doesn&rsquo;t he ever
go motoring?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little nurse shook her head.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
&ldquo;He says it&rsquo;s so dull with just him and me.
The poor old gentleman should have had a family.
It&rsquo;s dreadful for him being alone. It just takes
all the heart out of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come to be the family,&rdquo; said Judy.
&ldquo;Oh, what wonderful palms!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They turned into a driveway lined with them,
and up to the hotel. It was an imposing building,
dazzling in fresh white paint; and glossy orange
trees, heavy with ripe fruit, stood on either side
of the entrance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. de Lisle&rsquo;s still in bed, of course,&rdquo; Miss
McPherson told her, &ldquo;but you may see him after
lunch. And I&rsquo;ve promised him he may go out
with you in a day or two. In a bath-chair, at
first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She left Judy to unpack, and have her lunch,
and hurried back to her patient.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall get on with her,&rdquo; Judy said to herself,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s human.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At about half-past two she knocked at Stephen&rsquo;s
door.
</p>

<p>
Miss McPherson had told her that he still
complained of numbness in his legs, so she was
prepared for the sight of the long, gaunt figure
stretched out so inertly on a bed near the window.
His head was turned her way, and as he held out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
a long arm, a pair of searching, sunken eyes met
hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy! Good girl, good girl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
meant to turn my face to the wall if you didn&rsquo;t
come. Miss McPherson, place her chair a little
nearer. That&rsquo;s it. Judy, Judy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re exactly the same &lsquo;Old Stephen&rsquo; I remember,&rdquo;
said Judy, unexpectedly moved at this
meeting, &ldquo;only gray instead of iron-gray.&rdquo; It
was silly to feel tearful. &ldquo;Do&mdash;do I look a bit
as you thought I&rsquo;d look?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He answered in a lower voice, still holding her
hand in a grip of surprising strength:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like your grandmother, thank God!
I prayed that you might be. It&rsquo;s the eyes, I think&mdash;yes,
it&rsquo;s the eyes and expression. I can build
her up, around your eyes. You always promised
to be a little like her. Ah, my dear, my dear, it
was good of you to come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good of me! You little know what you saved
me from!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Saved you from?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. You&mdash;I was simply desperate. I&rsquo;d
begun to hate myself and every one else, except
Madame Claire and Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Madame Claire,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Yes, I like
that. And what then?&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
&ldquo;I was longing to get away. You see I haven&rsquo;t
been out of England since I was sixteen. Except
to Scotland, and I don&rsquo;t count that. And I felt&mdash;stale.
You&rsquo;ve saved my life, I think, and now
you say I&rsquo;m going to save yours.&hellip; We&rsquo;ll have
a wonderful time, won&rsquo;t we, Miss McPherson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will be very nice,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss McPherson tells me you&rsquo;ll be out in a
day or two,&rdquo; Judy went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward
to the day when we can go motoring. There
must be glorious trips to be taken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned his eyes toward his nurse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What else did you tell her?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything I thought necessary.&rdquo; She pressed
her lips together but her eyes smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you were Scotch enough to keep a
secret.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can keep them when I choose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; Stephen said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as bad as I
pretended I was. I had a stroke. Yes, you
needn&rsquo;t jump, you over there. Thought I didn&rsquo;t
know, I suppose. Pish! Of course I knew. It
wasn&rsquo;t a bad one, Judy, but I knew it meant no
London for me for weeks, perhaps months. So
I made up my mind I was going to have you or
Eric. You, preferably. Something Claire said
made me think you might welcome a change just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
now, so I made Miss McPherson wire. And now
you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are even nicer than I thought you were,&rdquo;
laughed Judy. &ldquo;And what about Madame Claire?
Does she know too, that you&rsquo;re not&mdash;seriously
ill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He moved his head slightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She knows.&rdquo; He smiled, and Judy noticed
how his smile lightened his face with its rather
tragic lines and hollows. &ldquo;She said nothing but
sudden death or an earthquake would get you
away from your family. But I&rsquo;ve been pretty bad.
Even Miss McPherson admits that. Very bad.
And,&rdquo; he said, glowering into the corner where
Miss McPherson sat, &ldquo;I may be worse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t be while Miss Pendleton&rsquo;s
here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll just be taking a little air.
With your permission.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless you, run along! Poor child, she&rsquo;s
hardly left me for a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Miss McPherson went out, he watched her
upright little figure affectionately, from under his
strikingly white eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A plucky little soul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she has
borne with me wonderfully. Now, Judy, tell me
about your trip. Tell me about Claire, everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
you can think of, and about Noel and Eric. Good
Lord, how good this is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy sat and talked till the sky turned from
blue to deep orange, and the sun, long after it
had dropped behind the sea, sent beams like yellow
fingers raying up into the clear color its own
going had made; till the lovely Esterel Mountains
had grown warmly, richly purple&mdash;a purple
that seemed mixed with gold dust, and the palms,
untamed things that they are, made wild and
ragged silhouettes against the sunset.
</p>

<p>
At half-past four a waiter brought in tea, and
Miss McPherson, with color in her cheeks, came
in to officiate. Judy had talked herself out for
the present, so left the conversation to the other
two, who sparred in what appeared to be their
customary way. She watched the sky deepen to
the larkspur blue of night, and saw the lights
come pricking out in the harbor, and heard the
yacht bells and far-off voices, and knew that she
was very content.
</p>

<p>
As for Stephen, he took her hand for an instant
as she was about to go to her room to rest before
dressing for dinner, and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless you, Judy! I haven&rsquo;t been as happy as
this for over twenty years!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
&ldquo;Could anything be lovelier?&rdquo; thought Judy as
she stood at her window the next morning. The
wailing pipe of some street peddler had waked
her earlier&mdash;a weird, Oriental sound, pleasant to
open one&rsquo;s eyes to. She looked out over crooked
red roofs and beyond them to gray-green hills,
while below, to her left, the white yachts rode in
the harbor&mdash;the calm blue surface of which was
unmoved by a single ripple&mdash;beside less aristocratic
but more picturesque craft with pointed,
dark red sails.
</p>

<p>
The waiter had brought her her breakfast in
bed, but she had carried it to a table by the
window, and was having it there. A few moments
later the postman walked in&mdash;the casual
way people walked in and out of her room she
thought novel and charming&mdash;and handed her a
letter from Madame Claire, which was dated the
same day she left London.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">
&ldquo;Dearest Judy,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">wrote Madame Claire,</span>
</p>

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;This is just to reassure you, and explain
a little. Stephen isn&rsquo;t dangerously ill, thank
Heaven! I expect you&rsquo;ve discovered that by now.
But he had a slight stroke, and was lonely and
bored, poor old dear, and as I couldn&rsquo;t go to
him, he wanted you. I&rsquo;ve been trying to persuade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Millie for some time to let you go away somewhere,
but she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. Your health
was quite satisfactory, etc., etc. So I saw my
chance and took it. I know Stephen will take a
new lease of life with you there. Have the very
happiest time possible, and don&rsquo;t worry about
anything. I will be thinking of you in the sun.
I imagine almost that I can feel the warmth of
it myself; but perhaps it&rsquo;s only my hot water
bottle. I am writing this in bed, my rheumatism
being still a little troublesome. However, I am
reading some delightful books.
</p>
</div>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;Best love, dear Judy, from</p>
<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Claire.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>
That wonderful old woman! Judy knew that
she, from her two rooms at the Kensington Park
Hotel, had more influence on her life than any
one else in it. More even than Noel.
</p>

<p class="tb hide">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
Stephen was getting better slowly and with
patient determination, but although she could see
an improvement in him from day to day, it was
not until the fifth day of her stay that he was
considered well enough to go out in a bath-chair&mdash;a
vehicle he despised. His detestation of it
was somewhat mitigated by the fact that Judy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
was walking beside it, and he was persuaded, before
they had been out very long, to admit that
he was enjoying it. They went past the Casino
as far as the harbor, which seemed to Judy more
Italian than French, and they walked under the
weird maze made by the tortured gray branches
of the plane trees, that reminded her of something
in Dante&rsquo;s Inferno; then to the market place
where she bought persimmons bursting with over-ripeness,
and ate them then and there, ruining her
handkerchief. Stephen bought flowers, and chatted
in his excellent French with the brown-faced
peasant women who sold them. They walked
along the front again as far as La Reserve, where
he promised to take her for lobsters as soon as he
was well enough. Handsome cars flashed past
them and Judy had just said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the
Rolls-Royce was a hibernating bird,&rdquo; when a particularly
fine one went slowly by. She saw a man&rsquo;s
face looking back at them through the little window
at the rear, and in another second the car
stopped and began backing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Stephen gruffly. He disliked
bothering with people he knew only slightly,
and it annoyed him to have people continually
asking him how he was.
</p>

<p>
A man got out of the car and walked toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
them&mdash;a strange figure in the sunlight. He gave
the impression of heaviness and at the same time
of agility. His movements were quick and forceful.
He wore a shapeless black overcoat&mdash;a hideous
enough garment at any time&mdash;but there, in
the gold light of the southern sun, it seemed to
cast a Philistine gloom all about it. He would
have passed unnoticed in Wall Street or the City,
but on the Riviera in his bowler hat and his dark
clothes, Judy thought he insulted the day.
</p>

<p>
He went straight to Stephen, and the moment
he spoke, Judy knew he was an American.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I recall myself to your memory, sir?&rdquo;
he inquired, aware that he was not immediately
recognized. &ldquo;I am Whitman Colebridge, whom
you last knew out in the Argentine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whitman Colebridge! Of course, of course!&rdquo;
exclaimed Stephen with some geniality. &ldquo;Well,
well! That&rsquo;s more years ago than I like to remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good spell,&rdquo; agreed the other. &ldquo;But I
never forget a face or a name, once I&rsquo;ve known
them both pretty well. I&rsquo;m glad of an opportunity
of renewing our acquaintance. You were
very good to the young man I was then, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was I? Was I indeed? That seems to have
slipped my memory. But I am delighted to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
it. Judy, my dear, allow me to introduce quite
an old friend, Mr. Whitman Colebridge, of &hellip;
of &hellip; wait!&rdquo; He held up a thin hand, smiling.
&ldquo;Of Cincinnati.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s pretty smart of you, sir, to remember
that,&rdquo; exclaimed the younger man, who had
shaken hands strongly with Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is,&rdquo; Stephen remarked to
Judy, &ldquo;but in America it&rsquo;s always &lsquo;Mr. Jones of
St. Louis,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mr. Smith of Council Bluffs,&rsquo; or
<ins title="Add left quote before Mr. Robinson">&lsquo;Mr. Robinson of Denver.&rsquo;</ins>
One learns to associate
the name with the place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which shows,&rdquo; suggested Judy, &ldquo;that a love
of titles still lingers in the Republican breast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, I expect,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Colebridge,
in whose eyes Judy, it seemed, had immediately
found favor. &ldquo;But what about this old-fashioned
vehicle of yours? This doesn&rsquo;t signify that you&rsquo;re
an invalid, I trust?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a miserable, good-for-nothing old
man for some time,&rdquo; Stephen answered, &ldquo;with
most of Job&rsquo;s ailments, but without his virtues.
Now, however, since Miss Pendleton of London
has come to lighten my darkness, I mean to get
well. Yes, distinctly I mean to get well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; approved Mr. Colebridge.
&ldquo;This one-man Victoria that you&rsquo;ve got here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
doesn&rsquo;t look good to me. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten
our trip over the Andes together, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; agreed Stephen, nodding. &ldquo;That was
a trip! Pleasant to look back upon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take a trip
over the Esterel Mountains in a day or two. Mr.
de Lisle hasn&rsquo;t been out of Cannes since he first
came here,&rdquo; she told Mr. Colebridge, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re
planning some trips for next week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have your own automobile here?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Colebridge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Stephen said. &ldquo;We mean to hire
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why do that, sir? Here is mine&rdquo;&mdash;he
waved his hand toward his property&mdash;&ldquo;at your
disposal. The chauffeur is a native of these parts,
and I needn&rsquo;t brag about the machine because
you are well acquainted with its virtues. So why
not make use of it, with or without its owner?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s very kind,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;but
really &hellip; no, no, we couldn&rsquo;t think of it. I
don&rsquo;t see why you should burden yourself with
an irascible invalid. Do you, Judy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Colebridge will take us out some
day, and see how he likes us,&rdquo; said Judy, who
wasn&rsquo;t at all sure that she liked Mr. Colebridge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
&ldquo;But we certainly couldn&rsquo;t commandeer your car,
as you so kindly suggest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here alone,&rdquo; said Mr. Colebridge, &ldquo;the
machine holds seven, and I don&rsquo;t talk French.
So you&rsquo;d be doing me a real kindness. I&rsquo;m staying
at the Hotel Beaulieu. May I ask where
you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stopping at the Riviera,&rdquo; Stephen told
him. &ldquo;Come and see us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall avail myself of your kind invitation.
I presume you play, Miss Pendleton?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Play? Oh, the Casino? I haven&rsquo;t been yet,
but I mean to go, when Mr. de Lisle is better.
I&rsquo;ve never gambled and I&rsquo;m longing to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I go there every night,&rdquo; said the heavy one.
&ldquo;I flatter myself I know the game, sir. When
I&rsquo;m ahead I quit. And I generally quit ahead.&rdquo;
He clapped his hand to his pocket, and then felt
inside his coat. Judy expected bank notes to
appear, but instead he produced a gold cigar case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you smoke, sir? I reckon these are
superior to what you can obtain hereabouts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man waved them away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If they were made on Olympus for Jove himself,
I couldn&rsquo;t smoke one,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; commiserated the other, taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
one himself. &ldquo;You used to be fond of a good
cigar in the old days, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fond!&rdquo; exclaimed Stephen. &ldquo;Do you call
that fond! I&rsquo;d sell my immortal soul for one now,
if it weren&rsquo;t for my doctor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Colebridge, turning to Judy,
&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t detain you. It&rsquo;s been a real pleasure
to meet you, Miss Pendleton, and to see you again,
sir. Suppose I come around Monday, and take
you both to Grasse? That&rsquo;s just a pleasant, easy
little run. Say about two-thirty. I hope you will
do me the honor, Miss Pendleton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There seemed no reason to refuse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If Mr. de Lisle&rsquo;s well enough&mdash;and I feel sure
he will be,&rdquo; she said, shaking Mr. Colebridge&rsquo;s
proffered hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On Monday, then. I shall look forward to
that with real pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They watched him, his long black cigar in his
mouth, get into his beautiful car again and go
smoothly off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd
thing! I haven&rsquo;t thought of that fellow for over
ten years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about him. What is he? One of
the &lsquo;Captains of Industry&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
&ldquo;Something of that sort, I expect. We met
in the Argentine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me he was there on a holiday!
That man never took a holiday in his life. Did
you ever see such clothes? He looked as though
he was on his way to a directors&rsquo; meeting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was just a younger edition in those days
of what he is now. He told me, I remember,
that he was the forerunner of &lsquo;big business.&rsquo;
Connected with some great exporting house, I
think. Details have left my mind. But he impressed
me. Kind, full of bluff, pushing, selfish,
likable. No real humor. Oh, he can see a joke,
but that doesn&rsquo;t always mean humor. No philosophy
of life&mdash;yet. No sense of <em>values</em>. Values,
yes! It&rsquo;s an interesting type. Egotistic. But
powerful. I knew he&rsquo;d get on. We had some
long talks, I remember. He liked me for some
reason. I was able to do him a good turn, I
think, but I forget what it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His &aelig;sthetic or beauty-loving side is utterly
undeveloped,&rdquo; laughed Judy. &ldquo;Hence those
clothes. He&rsquo;s rather terrible in a way, and yet
I dare say I might like him if I knew him better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might,&rdquo; mused Stephen, &ldquo;you might.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="greeting epubmaker-bquote-hack3">
&ldquo;Dearest Claire,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">wrote Judy.</span>
</p>
<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;Every moment that I spend here in this
lovely place, I say to myself, &lsquo;You have Claire
to thank for this.&rsquo; I know now how cleverly
you managed it all. A hint here, a word there.
And I know that you never intended to let Eric
come, even if he could have arranged it. That
was merely to satisfy the family. Oh, I know
your little ways!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As for your old Stephen, I adore him. And
he&rsquo;s really making a wonderful recovery. I&rsquo;ll
bring him back to you, Claire. My one object in
life now is to help to bring you and him together
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ve seen Major Crosby again?
I do hope you have, for I feel you&rsquo;d be so good
for him, and it&rsquo;s absurd for him to be so out of
touch with things. I know you like him and I&rsquo;m
very glad, for I like him, and I know Noel does
too. I don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that he&rsquo;ll
ever be anything but poor. Even if his book
should prove to be a classic, it would never bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
him in much money. All the same I feel sure
that it&rsquo;s a remarkable book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a man here who is the very opposite
of Major Crosby. I feel they can hardly be made
of the same stuff. This man is an American whom
Stephen knew years ago in the Argentine. He&rsquo;s
very rich, and not afflicted with modesty. He has
no moods, no reserves, and no curiosity. I never
realized before what an agreeable quality curiosity
was until I met him. Europe is a playground
for him. Not that he knows how to play&mdash;he
doesn&rsquo;t. He merely does what other people do,
and spends prodigious sums of money, and when
he tries to be gay or facetious it&rsquo;s like watching a
steam engine playing with its tail. We spar a
good deal, but he seems to like it. He makes me
ponderous compliments&mdash;oh, so ponderous! I
tell him I&rsquo;m not used to compliments, and that in
England the more we approve of people the less
we trouble to let them know it, and that the only
person who sometimes tells me I&rsquo;m rather nice is
my brother Noel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Say,&rsquo; remarks Mr. Colebridge, &lsquo;that brother
of yours must be kinder human!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Assheton are here and they
chaperon me at the Casino evenings after Stephen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
has gone to bed. We usually make a foursome,
for Mr. Colebridge nearly always joins
<ins title="remove right double quote after us.">us.</ins>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much I&rsquo;m enjoying it
all, Claire. I think I must have died and gone
to Heaven. Certainly the Channel wasn&rsquo;t unlike
the Styx. I feel all the time though that it&rsquo;s you
who ought to be here with Stephen instead of me.
But he&rsquo;s going to get well, and you&rsquo;re going to
see him again. Miss McPherson is a dear. I
gathered that she was from Stephen&rsquo;s letters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How are Eric and Louise getting on? But
I expect Noel will tell me all the news. You have
all you can do to keep Stephen supplied with
letters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by, Madame Claire. Remember me to
your daughter Millie when you see her. Really,
mother took my coming here as a personal affront.
She thinks that no one but Gordon should have
any advantages. Aren&rsquo;t some parents odd, sometimes?
</p>
</div>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;Your very loving,</p>
<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Judy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Very satisfactory, thought Madame Claire, as
she finished reading the letter. All sorts of ends
were furthered by this visit. Stephen would take
a new lease on life with Judy there. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
just the tonic that he needed. He would be certain
to want to settle something on her. If he
had wished to before he knew her, how much
more would he now! She would, more or less
unconsciously, present her own image to him, as
she was to-day. Heaven alone knew how he had
been picturing her all these years! And, too,
Judy would meet&mdash;was meeting&mdash;new people.
She already had an admirer. Madame Claire
was no matchmaker; she abhorred matchmaking;
but she knew that Judy was interested in Major
Crosby and it would help her to know how deeply
she was interested if she could compare him with
other men. This Mr. Colebridge&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t at
all Judy&rsquo;s sort, perhaps&mdash;and yet he might attract
her by his very differences. Or, if he failed to
attract her, he might help her to define her feelings
for the other more clearly.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire was no advocate of marriage
as the only career for women, but Judy&rsquo;s gifts
seemed all to be in that direction. She had charm,
tact, good sense. Her other qualities would
emerge once she was away from the suffocating
atmosphere of Eaton Square and Millie. She had
never had a chance. Not that marriage with
Major Crosby, for instance, would offer much
scope for her talents &hellip; and yet, on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
hand, it might &hellip; it might. Well, well, Madame
Claire told herself, she wouldn&rsquo;t raise a
finger to bring it about. But she meant the girl
to have a breathing space &hellip; time to think, and
a new environment to think in. If she herself
had had that at a certain period of her own
life.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
She was expecting Eric this afternoon between
five and six. Eric and Louise &hellip; there was
a problem for her untangling! Two charming
people&mdash;for Louise could be charming&mdash;who were
at heart fond of each other, and yet were utterly
at cross purposes. Madame Claire held the remarkable
belief that no problem existed without
its solution&mdash;however difficult that solution might
be to come by&mdash;just as she believed that every
poison had its antidote, and every evil its complementary
good. Why, then, couldn&rsquo;t she think
of a way to bring those two together? Louise&rsquo;s
mind wanted prying open. It had closed on its
jealousies as a pitcher plant closes on its food.
Nothing that was in could get out, and nothing
that was out could get in. An unfortunate state
of affairs!
</p>

<p>
Eric came in bringing with him something
fresh and vital that always seemed to accompany
him. Judy called it his aura. He was quick in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
all his movements&mdash;the sort of man who gets
through a great deal in a day and without fuss
or bustle.
</p>

<p>
He advanced on Madame Claire and kissed
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look wonderful! I&rsquo;ve half an hour to
spend with you to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew up a chair beside hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get very tired of being always
busy?&rdquo; she asked him, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I do. But I must either be in the thick
of things or out of them altogether. And just
now things are very thick indeed, and getting
thicker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really enjoy being outside,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One
sees so much better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But are you outside?&rdquo; He looked narrowly
at her with humorous, quizzical eyes. &ldquo;Are you?
I never knew you to be, puller of many threads!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I give a feeble jerk now and then. It&rsquo;s
all I can do. Tell me about Louise. I haven&rsquo;t
seen her for a week or more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About Louise? But, my dear mother, if I
once start talking about Louise &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes? Well, why not? What am I here for?
Is there any &hellip; improvement, do you think?&rdquo;
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
&ldquo;Improvement? Let me tell you, then.
You&rsquo;ve brought it on yourself. I warned you.&rdquo;
He laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about last night. Last
night we had Sir Henry Boyle-Stevens to dinner,
and Mr. Stedman. About halfway through dinner
Sir Henry said to Louise, but looking at me
and smiling, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great comfort to me to be
working with your husband. He is untiring and
dependable.&rsquo; Old Sir Henry does like me, and
we&rsquo;ve always got on together like anything.
Would you like to hear what Louise said in reply?
Would you? Very well. She said&mdash;I will give
you her exact words and their emphasis&mdash;&lsquo;I suppose
Eric <em>is</em> dependable, <em>politically</em>.&rsquo; &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo;
you observe, and then the accent on &lsquo;politically.&rsquo;
Sir Henry looked quickly at her, and then at me,
and changed the subject. She meant me to hear.
Then the next thing. After dinner the Lewis
Pringles came in. We were still in the dining
room&mdash;the men, I mean&mdash;and when we joined the
rest in the drawing-room Louise greeted me with
these words&mdash;for my ears alone&mdash;&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t
have hurried, Eric. I was just enjoying hearing
my own voice for a change.&rsquo; You ask me if
there&rsquo;s any improvement! What am I to do?
We can&rsquo;t go on like this much longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. And I don&rsquo;t think you ought to.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
He flung himself back into his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why does she live in my house if she dislikes
me as much as that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t dislike you, my dear. It&rsquo;s an
extraordinary nature. Do you remember the unfortunate
girl in the fairy tale? Every time she
opened her mouth toads and snails and other
horrid things came out of it. Well, that&rsquo;s Louise.
That old hag jealousy has bewitched her. She&rsquo;s
not happy, poor thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she is happy. I don&rsquo;t see how
she can be. But I can&rsquo;t make her happy, and she
can&rsquo;t help making me miserable. I can&rsquo;t even
ignore her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Try living apart for six months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She suggested that herself. Of course she
expects me to go down on my knees and beg her
to stay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it! Let her go. Make her go.
Give it out to your friends that the doctor says
she must live in the country for a while. Insist
on her going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who would look after the house? I could
shut it up I suppose and go to a hotel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no. Don&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;ll find some one,&rdquo;
said Madame Claire. &ldquo;You leave that to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean a housekeeper?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, at the moment. I&rsquo;ll think of
somebody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louise may not come back,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;ll come back. She has no intention
of letting any other woman have you.
You&rsquo;ll see &hellip; only you must see that she stays
away six months this time. That last visit to
Mistley wasn&rsquo;t long enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you understand her better than I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I do understand her. That&rsquo;s the curious
thing about it. But it always seems to me that
odd people are much easier to understand than
simple people. Once you give people credit for
being odd, nothing that they do surprises you.
What&rsquo;s so difficult is to give people credit for
being simple. Now if Louise would only understand
that you are very simple&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very. You&rsquo;re one of the least complex people
I&rsquo;ve ever known. None of my children are complex.
Not even Connie, who thinks she is. By
the way, have you seen her lately?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for several days. I called at her hotel
just before coming here, but she was out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, didn&rsquo;t you know? This is the afternoon
of Petrovitch&rsquo;s concert. She&rsquo;s there, with Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Feasting her eyes and ears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay and hear Noel&rsquo;s account of
it.&rdquo; She looked at her watch. &ldquo;He promised
he&rsquo;d come in afterwards. I&rsquo;m glad he took her.
It will be an outlet for her emotions. The papers
just hint that Petrovitch is on the downward
grade, Eric. Not the master that he was. He&rsquo;s
not very young, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose not. He wasn&rsquo;t a young man when
she first knew him. But if the world were to reject
and despise him, Connie would cling to him
all the more. So there&rsquo;s no hope in that direction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; agreed Madame Claire. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d
pride herself on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They talked for nearly half an hour, and Eric
was about to go when Dawson opened the door
to announce &ldquo;Master Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Noel. &ldquo;Two birds with
one stone. That&rsquo;s splendid. Greetings, Claire.
I&rsquo;m bursting with talk. How are you, Eric?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re bursting to hear you talk,&rdquo; Madame
Claire told him. &ldquo;Sit down and tell us all
about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Noel stretched himself out in a
chair and ran his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;I
feel a bit of a rag. Concerts always make me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
feel like that, but this one was rather more exhausting
than usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it a good concert?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, of course I&rsquo;m no musician, but it seemed
all right to me. Several thousand people had
come to hear the lion roar, and they all seemed
pleased with his roaring. But first of all, I wish
you could have seen Connie, complete with dark
shadows under her eyes, large black hat and a
bunch of gardenias. Petrovitch saw her at once&mdash;we
had seats almost under the piano&mdash;and they
exchanged soul to soul looks. And then he sat
down to play. Gosh, the fellow can play! He
even had me spellbound. As for Connie&mdash;but I
leave that to your imagination. I&rsquo;ll bet Petrovitch
played as never before. Sees nephew sitting
beside beautiful aunt. Tries to charm aunt
away from nephew. Does so&mdash;or jolly near it.
Connie sat there with her soul in her eyes. I&rsquo;m
sorry to have to mention souls so often, but the
narrative seems to require it. Well, I wish you
could have heard the applause. People stood up
and clapped and clapped and clapped. The gallery
yelled and shouted. Illiodor&mdash;that&rsquo;s his unChristian
name&mdash;tore off two or three encores
and bowed and bowed, and then gazed at Connie
and bowed some more, and then finally came back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and played something very tender&mdash;you know the
sort of thing&mdash;a fragment, a thought, a tear&mdash;and
then gazed some more at Connie and that was
the end of it. I sat there feeling proud all the
time. Proprietary, I suppose you&rsquo;d call it. Something
like this: &lsquo;You like it? Good. Oh, yes, in
a way he&rsquo;s one of the family. Fellow my aunt
ran off with. Quite one of the family.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How absurd you are, Noel!&rdquo; laughed Madame
Claire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then what happened?&rdquo; asked Eric.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we got out finally and headed for home.
Connie hung on my arm like a wilted flower, and
I can tell you, she&rsquo;s no light weight. I couldn&rsquo;t
possibly put her in a &rsquo;bus in the state she was in&mdash;I
have some sense of the fitness of things&mdash;so we
took a taxi and she sat in it with her hands clasped
and her eyes fixed before her, murmuring,
&lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he divine, divine!&rsquo; I felt that the situation
was becoming a bit too tense, so I said, &lsquo;Yes,
he&rsquo;s all right, but I think Grock&rsquo;s more amusing.&rsquo;
But it didn&rsquo;t annoy her a bit. She just kept on
rocking herself and murmuring, &lsquo;Divine, divine!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you leave her in that state?&rdquo; Eric inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t recover for several days. When
we got back to the hotel she thanked me as if I&rsquo;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
saved her from drowning&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t tell her it was
all your idea, Claire&mdash;and said she&rsquo;d carry the
memory of that afternoon in her heart forever.
I wonder? I&rsquo;m pretty sure she will see him, or
write to him. But there&rsquo;s one thing about Connie&mdash;she&rsquo;s
honest. She won&rsquo;t see him and not tell
me. I can trust her for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Later on the conversation turned on Major
Crosby. Madame Claire asked Noel if he had
seen him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, about that,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;I went to see
his doctor &hellip; the nice old fellow who came
in that night; and I asked him to please send the
bill to me. &lsquo;Bill?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What bill?&rsquo; When
I said &lsquo;Major Crosby&rsquo;s,&rsquo; he clapped me on the
back and said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t send bills to the man who
risked his life to get my son out of a shell-hole,
under fire.&rsquo; So now we know. He seems to
think the world of Chip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Madame Claire. &ldquo;Yes, gallant.&hellip;
I knew that. I hope he comes to see me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said he meant to when I saw him last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I seem to be the only one of the family who
hasn&rsquo;t met him,&rdquo; said Eric. &ldquo;What do the others
think of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Noel told him, &ldquo;Gordon didn&rsquo;t think
anything&mdash;or anyhow, didn&rsquo;t say. Helen liked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
him&mdash;she&rsquo;s a good sort when she wants to be, and
talks about having him meet influential people&mdash;publishers,
I suppose she means. Mother said
he wasn&rsquo;t connected with any Crosbys she ever
heard of, and dad looked him up in
<cite><ins title="remove question mark after Who's Who">Who&rsquo;s
Who</ins></cite> and not finding him asked me how long
I&rsquo;d known him and what clubs he belonged to.
Connie thinks he&rsquo;s quite charming, but doesn&rsquo;t
understand women! Yes, I thought you&rsquo;d smile.
But what I want to know is, what does Judy think
of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather interested,&rdquo; said Madame Claire.
&ldquo;What do you think of him yourself, Noel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of the decentest fellows I ever knew.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But hasn&rsquo;t a bob, I understand,&rdquo; remarked
Eric. &ldquo;Judy&rsquo;s a brave girl if she doesn&rsquo;t funk it.
If only she had something of her own.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that would make all the difference. However,
I&rsquo;m certain nothing&rsquo;s been said, and I rather
think nothing will be said, unless &hellip;&rdquo; But she
changed her mind about finishing her sentence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your own news, Noel?&rdquo; asked
Eric. &ldquo;Have you settled everything with Teal,
about going to Germany?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, thanks to you. Reparations Committee.
And I haven&rsquo;t spoken a word of German, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to Hun prisoners during the war, since I was at
school. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s my line, but the screw&rsquo;s
fair, and it ought to be interesting, and besides,
there aren&rsquo;t too many things going for a
<ins title="change pore to poor">poor</ins>
cripple. I like Cecil Teal, in spite of his name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When do you go?&rdquo; Madame Claire asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In three weeks. Do you think Judy&rsquo;ll be
back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain she&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then. Well, I must be off.
Coming my way, Eric? I&rsquo;m going to the club.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As they were leaving, Madame Claire called
Noel back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel, tell Connie that I want to see her to-morrow
or the next day. As soon as she&rsquo;s recovered.
And, Eric, you&rsquo;ll let me know about
Louise, won&rsquo;t you? She&rsquo;s not to go without saying
good-by to me &hellip; if she does go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; he
explained, turning to Noel, &ldquo;finds life with me intolerable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s divorce, thank Heaven!&rdquo; Noel
said. &ldquo;I always feel about marriage and divorce
the way I feel about those illuminated signs in
theaters&mdash;the exits, you know, in case of fire. One
simply wouldn&rsquo;t go into a theater unless they
were there.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
&ldquo;In this case, however,&rdquo; said Madame Claire,
&ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t going to be a fire, and Eric&rsquo;s only
seen the first act of the play. Good night, my
dears.&rdquo;
</p>

        </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Judy&rsquo;s</span>
letter was followed by one from Stephen.
Madame Claire felt that it was from some one
very close at hand. He seemed to be coming
nearer to her daily, and she no longer visualized
him as separated from her by so many miles of
land and water. He was accessible now. They
were more readily accessible to each other by
thoughts. She felt more confidence in his health,
too, and in his determination to come to England
again. She had been wise in sending Judy to him!
</p>


<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">Stephen wrote,</span> &ldquo;how much
there is of you in Judy. She has your way of
understanding what one wants to say almost before
one has said it. She doesn&rsquo;t make me feel
an old man. We talk as equals. She is very
human and is gifted with real humor, which means
that she enjoys the humorous side of mankind. I
think that her not very happy youth&mdash;for it&rsquo;s
obvious that she has been far from happy at home&mdash;has
given her a certain depth and insight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is much amused by an old friend of mine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
an American named Colebridge. We met years
ago in the Argentine, and he considers that he has
reason to be grateful for something in the past.
Together, the two are a source of great entertainment
to me. Judy becomes every moment
more British, and he&mdash;well, he couldn&rsquo;t become
more American. He admires Judy enormously,
and I think he is ready to lay a not inconsiderable
fortune at her feet. I wish I could remember
their talk. Yesterday we motored to Grasse, and
coming home we passed peasants returning from
their work in the fields. Simple, contented
people, with clothes colored like the earth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;In America,&rsquo; says Mr. Colebridge, &lsquo;all these
folks would own Fords.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then thank God for Europe!&rsquo; says Judy;
and so they go on, until at last Mr. Colebridge
turns to me and says, &lsquo;Say, I guess I&rsquo;m ready to
agree to anything Miss Pendleton says. She&rsquo;s
got more sense than any woman I ever met.&rsquo;
Which takes the wind out of Judy&rsquo;s sails. They
make me feel years younger. Colebridge wears
the most Philistine clothes, and never looks at
the scenery. He sees nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy often goes to the Casino, and she tells
me she saw Chiozzi there last night. He was
with Mlle. Pauline, whom Judy describes as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
most exquisite creature. She was struck with the
contrast between them&mdash;Chiozzi so dark and
hideous, and the woman so fair and pretty&mdash;and
she asked some one who they were. She says
Chiozzi is extremely jealous and was constantly
watching his companion. She also says that he
was losing a great deal of money&mdash;Connie&rsquo;s
money, perhaps?&mdash;at the tables. He has left
this hotel, so I never see him now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss McPherson seems to think I will be able
to travel in less than a month. A month, Claire!
Only thirty days. It&rsquo;s nothing. And yet, it&rsquo;s an
eternity. I might have another stroke&mdash;no, no!
I feel sure I won&rsquo;t. Not with Judy here. I think
it was sheer boredom that brought it on before.
That, and a hopeless feeling that I should never
quite reach you. Now I seem to have accomplished
half the journey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have said nothing to Judy as yet about a
settlement. It is a difficult subject, and I feel I
must tread lightly. All the same, I mean to have
my way. If the young deny us these pleasures,
what is left for us? Of course, if she were to
marry Colebridge she wouldn&rsquo;t want it, but that
I feel almost certain she will not do. They are
poles apart. It&rsquo;s not because of their nationality.
It&rsquo;s because of their outlook on life. It wouldn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
do. If Judy were less sensitive, less feeling, less
intelligent, it might.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I am aweary of this eternal sunshine.
And when the sun does not shine, it all seems very
drab. One is constantly reminded here of too
much that is rich&mdash;and gross. And yet it is lovely,
I suppose, very lovely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you I want, Claire, and London. For
the first time in my life I&rsquo;m unspeakably, unutterably
homesick. I long to see the rain on London
streets, the lamps&rsquo; yellow eyes through the deep
blue haze and smoke. I want crocuses and primroses
instead of mimosa. I want little, homely,
decorous shops, and people who put on their
clothes merely to cover them and to keep warm.
I want your fireside and you and Dawson, and
crumpets for tea. What an old fool I am! I
would like to hear the old talk of the London
that I knew; these memoirs, that play, such and
such a speech; what So and So said to Blank when
he met him in the lobby of the House; who is
talked of as the next Speaker. I hardly dare look
at the papers, Claire, for then I know how many
years there are between the old talk and the talk
of to-day. The jingle of hansom bells seem to
run through it all, and faint, forgotten old tunes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
&ldquo;But it will all be preserved, summed up, epitomized
in you. I will find it all again in you.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is Judy who has brought back this love of
London. It is she who has made it fresh again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says your hair is perfectly white. How
pretty it must be!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by! I grow verbose, lachrymose, and
comatose.
</p>
</div>


<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, he would find London changed, though
it had changed less than most Western cities.
But he would find that it had retained its old
character even though it had assumed new manners.
And after all, why pretend that it had not
improved? It had improved. It was easier to
get about now than it had been in Stephen&rsquo;s day.
There was more to do. There was less misery
among the poor. One needn&rsquo;t feel so suicidal
on Sundays. There were better shops, better
libraries, and&mdash;yes&mdash;more and better books. Better
preachers in the pulpits, too, better food,
better music, better teachers in the schools. And
if one regretted the hansom bells and the old
tunes, that was because one regretted one&rsquo;s youth,
and the friends of one&rsquo;s youth. But the present
couldn&rsquo;t be blamed for that. The present was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
full of promise, let the old fogies say what they
pleased. The sea was rougher, perhaps, but the
port was nearer &hellip; and after all, seasickness
wasn&rsquo;t often fatal, and was very often beneficial.
Not that there weren&rsquo;t alarming symptoms&mdash;there
were.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
Stephen and she could still go to the Temple
and see the old, unchanged gray stones, and the
vivid grass making a carpet for the delicate feet
of spring when she visited London; and she loved
to visit London, that beloved guest, as though
she delighted in contrasting her fleeting and perennial
loveliness with what was gray and immutable.
The old, slow river, too, and the towers of Westminster&mdash;they
could look at them and see little
change there.
</p>

<p>
And after all, they hadn&rsquo;t stood still themselves.
They had gone on. If they hadn&rsquo;t, she wouldn&rsquo;t
have fitted into the picture to-day, as she knew
she did, nor would Stephen have found so much
in common with Judy. No, she had long ago said
good-by to the hansom bells and the bustles and
the bad doctors and the inferior plumbing&mdash;let&rsquo;s
be honest&mdash;and the extremely uncomfortable
traveling, and she had said good-by without
regret.
</p>

<p>
She was writing to him the following afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
putting these thoughts on paper while they were
still fresh in her mind, when Major Crosby called.
She had hoped he would come. Certainly he
wouldn&rsquo;t go to Eaton Square for news of Judy.
He would come to her. She wondered how far
he would commit himself. Here was another
simple man, but simple in a different way from
Eric&rsquo;s way. Major Crosby&rsquo;s was the simplicity
of the hermit, Eric&rsquo;s of the clear thinking man of
action who had no use for subtleties. She hoped
he would feel that he could unburden himself to
a woman of her age.
</p>

<p>
That, evidently, was one of the things he had
come for. Madame Claire wanted to be able to
make up her mind about him to-day. She had
liked him before, but to-day she hoped to be able
to say, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the man for Judy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He very soon asked for news of her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s being extraordinarily good for my old
friend Stephen de Lisle,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
well, Major Crosby, to keep one&rsquo;s hold on the
present generation. Mr. de Lisle had almost lost
his, and he was slipping back. That&rsquo;s why I sent
Judy to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will she be back in time to see her brother
before he goes?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m sure of it. She&rsquo;ll be very lonely
without Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What nice eyes the man had! Blue-gray eyes,
rather misty, like the eyes of a kitten or a baby.
The face was serious&mdash;a little too serious, she
thought. She liked it though. It was a good
face. She liked the thin, rather aquiline nose,
the close-cut, brown mustache, the mouth with its
expression of peculiar sweetness. She could picture
him performing acts of curious bravery, unconscious
of any heroism. A man who could
study Druidism in the trenches!&hellip; But life
was passing him by, as it would pass Judy by, unless
she made up her mind to grasp it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how nearly finished is
that prodigious book of yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s practically done. I&rsquo;m still polishing it
up though. It won&rsquo;t be a popular book, Lady
Gregory. In fact I think it will be very unpopular.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With whom will it be unpopular?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, with people who lay much stress upon
ritual and creed. I think they will dislike knowing
how much of the pagan ritual has come down
to us, and how closely our own beliefs are bound
up with those of savage peoples. And there are
others who don&rsquo;t like hearing that Christianity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
is, comparatively speaking, modern, and that there
are other vastly more ancient revelations. And
there are people who won&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;ve said
about the belief in reincarnation, nor be willing
to accede an important place to the so-called modern
religions, such as Christian Science, New
Thought, and Spiritualism. The book will be
banned, undoubtedly, by one great church, and
public libraries will think twice before circulating
it. And yet I had to write it, and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve
written it. I only wish it were fuller and more
convincing. It lacks what print must always lack&mdash;the
power to persuade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you wish to persuade us &hellip; of what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The need for tolerance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think we are still intolerant? And yet
there are plenty of people who say we have grown
too tolerant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is only one tolerance that I deplore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tolerance toward the man who believes in
nothing at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why have you singled out that unfortunate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because we have much to fear from him.&rdquo;
He got up and stood with his back to the fire.
&ldquo;When men believe in nothing, they rot. If history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
teaches us anything, it teaches us that. The
world has had its greatest moments at the times
of its greatest faith. Then when belief goes, the
decline begins. But first these people who believe
in nothing set up idols of their own making.
They call them by fine names&mdash;liberty, perhaps,
or communism, or the freedom of the proletariat,
or the gospel of anarchy, or mob rule. But they
very soon tire of worshiping even them. Then
fear enters their hearts. They believe in no hereafter
and no god. They see that life here is short
and uncertain. They see that there are good
things in the world&mdash;fine food, fine clothes, money,
power. They want the cash. The credit can go.
The people who lay up treasures in heaven are
fools. Well then, let them lay up their treasures
in heaven&mdash;and let them go after them. They
themselves mean to have what they can see, feel,
touch, smell. They begin trampling, stampeding,
cursing. Get, get, get, they cry. What do they
attack first? The churches. Away with restraint,
away with rules, away with sickly faith. They
want more concrete things and they mean to get
them. Then blood incites them further. They
kill and kill and kill. Killing and grabbing&mdash;they
are occupied with nothing else. Some for the sake
of appearances or because they like the sound of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
words go about shouting their phrases. But
sooner or later they turn on each other; or their
followers, sick of blood, turn upon them. And
then, when there is a little peace, faith creeps
back into people&rsquo;s hearts again, and a belief in
God. And they wonder how the madness came,
and they try to wipe out the blood stains and live
sanely again. And they go back to work in the
fields and stop hating each other. Perhaps they
have learned something. Not always. But they
have got tolerance again, and a belief. And with
those two things they can begin once more. To
believe in something beyond this world, to have
faith in the destiny of the soul &hellip; that&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, suddenly abashed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as if I
were addressing a meeting. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve liked it. Go on. So your book
shows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shows that any faith is good. Shows that all
beliefs are so intermingled that they are almost
inextricable. It shows that what matters is their
common foundation&mdash;the belief in a Divine
Creator. Without these various revelations that
are the foundations of religion, the world would
have been chaos. Destroy them, and the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
will be chaos. Christianity is the light on the
path of the Western world. Other worlds, other
lights. But to say that we can walk without light,
or to shut our eyes and say there is no light&mdash;that
is the great insanity, the great evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she agreed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a religious fellow, in the ordinary
sense of the word,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and yet I&rsquo;m
more interested in religion than in any other subject.
I do go to church, but more as a student
than a worshiper. I like to think about the
psychology of a congregation, and the possible&mdash;the
probable benefits of worshiping all together
in a building with four walls and a roof.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It wasn&rsquo;t so difficult, after all, to draw him
out. She liked making him talk. And when she
thought she had drawn him out enough she rang
for tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course this work of yours is tremendously
interesting, but at the same time I feel more
than ever that you need diversions. The dancing
wasn&rsquo;t altogether a success, I gathered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he agreed, smiling, &rdquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wasn&rsquo;t.
But when we were discussing hobbies the other
day, I forgot to tell you that I had another, besides
religions. And that&rsquo;s the stage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire laughed.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
&ldquo;You extraordinary man! What aspect of the
stage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like writing plays. I&rsquo;ve written several, but
I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re any good and I&rsquo;ve never
tried to do anything with them. I don&rsquo;t think
my people would be real&mdash;especially the women.
I wonder&mdash;I&rsquo;d like&mdash;would you read them some
time? You&rsquo;re critical, but you&rsquo;re very kind, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I long to read them! Bring them. The
sooner the better. I love plays and I love the
theater, and though my criticisms may not be valuable,
you shall have them. I often wish Judy had
gone on the stage. She has the looks and she has
talent, too. But of course it would have killed
her parents.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was then that he took the plunge. She had
felt for some time that he was preparing to
take it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Pendleton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the only
woman I have ever met who has made me wish
I were a rich man&mdash;or a successful man. Not
that she would consider me if I were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think you&rsquo;re human!&rdquo; cried
Madame Claire. &ldquo;The stage; and now you&rsquo;re in
love with Judy. I&rsquo;m delighted, Major Crosby!
Delighted. Now we have two excellent diversions
for you. Plays, and love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Her old eyes twinkled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no talent for either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, let some one else judge of that! Let
Judy judge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked somewhat confused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have said what I did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not? I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give you away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I had any prospects at all &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;how strong
and how weak men can be! There&rsquo;s my son Eric,
for instance. A born fighter. In war, in politics,
no compromise. But in love&mdash;in love he has the
courage of a &hellip; of a schoolgirl. If he had
only <em>managed</em> his wife! What he needs is a
course in nettle-grasping. And so do you, Major
Crosby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think for a minute that Miss Pendleton&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused, hoping, she saw, that she would
help him out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That Miss Pendleton is interested?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, interested &hellip; she might be, just a little,
out of the kindness of her heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Major Crosby, let me tell you that women are
only kind when it gives them pleasure to be kind.
A woman will rarely put herself out, I&rsquo;m afraid,
for a man who bores her.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
&ldquo;But even if she were&mdash;interested&mdash;even if she
did think twice about me, which I find it very
difficult to believe, I&rsquo;ve nothing whatever to offer
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean you can&rsquo;t offer her money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only one of the things I haven&rsquo;t got.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stood in front of the fire again, as if to give
himself the advantage of higher ground. He
wanted to be convincing even while he hoped to
be convinced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All I ask you to do,&rdquo; said Madame Claire,
&ldquo;is, for your own sake, to give yourself a chance.
There are obstacles, admittedly, but don&rsquo;t begin
by throwing up earthworks as well. Don&rsquo;t <em>make</em>
obstacles. Mind you, I&rsquo;m not encouraging you.
I only know that Judy likes you more than she
likes most people. Beyond that I&rsquo;m completely
in the dark. Yes, Dawson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, m&rsquo;lady,&rdquo; said Dawson from the doorway,
&ldquo;can you see Miss Connie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Ask her to come in. No, don&rsquo;t go,
Major Crosby. You&rsquo;ve met my daughter,
Countess Chiozzi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to come again soon, if I may.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, smiling up at him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
&ldquo;I shall think I have lectured you too much. And
the plays&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget them!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He exchanged a few words with Connie as he
passed her in the hall, and she was graciously
polite to him. She never forgot for an instant,
in the presence of a man, that she was a charming
woman. After she had kissed her mother, however,
she felt that a remonstrance was justifiable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re not encouraging that man, I
hope?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Connie, my dear, I assure you I&rsquo;m not.
I think that the difference in our ages is really
too great.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother! I meant for Judy, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! But before I answer that, let me tell
you of something Eric and I thought of a few
days ago. Something to do with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before Connie had left her, an hour later, she
had agreed to give up her rooms at the hotel as
soon as Noel went to Germany, and go and keep
house for Eric.
</p>

<p>
She had been wondering how she was going to
bear her life after Noel left, she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If Eric really wants me, of course I&rsquo;ll go.
I&rsquo;m not a very good housekeeper, I&rsquo;m afraid.
I&rsquo;m so out of practice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will be a change for him,&rdquo; Madame Claire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
told her. &ldquo;Louise is rather too good. She fusses.
And besides, Eric won&rsquo;t be difficult. He has very
simple tastes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Connie, &ldquo;that from what I&rsquo;ve
heard, I shall be a better hostess than his wife
has been.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced of it,&rdquo; answered Madame
Claire.
</p>

<p>
When Connie had gone, she telephoned at once
to Eric, to tell him what she had done.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so obviously the best thing all round,&rdquo;
he agreed, &ldquo;that I simply never thought of it. If
it suits Connie, it suits me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It suits Connie very well. But of course you&rsquo;ll
say nothing to Louise. It will be time enough for
her to know when she&rsquo;s settled comfortably at
Mistley.&rdquo;
</p>

        </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Two</span>
weeks later the following letter came from
Judy:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">&ldquo;Dearest Claire,
</p>

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;This is the last letter I&rsquo;ll write to you from
here, as I&rsquo;m coming home so soon now. I wish
I could bring Stephen with me, but Miss McPherson
says he won&rsquo;t be ready to travel for another
week or so, and of course I want to be back in
time to spend a few days with Noel before he
goes. But Stephen is wonderfully better and
quite light-hearted, and, at the prospect of seeing
you, light-headed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Things have been happening here. Many
things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the first place we heard this morning that
a Count Somebody&mdash;our informant, Mr. Colebridge,
couldn&rsquo;t remember the name&mdash;had been
found murdered on the Upper Corniche Road.
He says it was an Italian name, and he is going
to find out all he can about it. I&rsquo;m almost certain
it will prove to be Chiozzi. He was so fearfully
jealous of that little dancer Mlle. Pauline.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
I can quite imagine that he might have tried to
kill her and that she might have stabbed him in
self-defense. The body, they say&mdash;or Mr. Colebridge
says&mdash;was dropped from a motor. They
have a great way of hushing things up here, but
we will try to find out all about it. Won&rsquo;t Connie
adore being a widow again? Of course you won&rsquo;t
say anything to anybody yet, as it would be so
awfully disappointing if it should turn out to be
some one else. How callous I am! But if you
could have seen him&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Stephen and I have been seeing life, and
rolling about in Mr. Colebridge&rsquo;s car. The man
won&rsquo;t take no for an answer when it comes to
going out with him. Yesterday we went to the
most wonderful little town&mdash;Gourdon, its name
was&mdash;perched on top of a mountain, like an eagle,
and looking over the Mediterranean for endless
miles. I saw Italy, and I&rsquo;m not at all sure I didn&rsquo;t
see Africa. It was really the place of my dreams;
the town fifteenth century, I imagine. I was in
heaven there. I ran away from Mr. Colebridge
and looked over the edge alone&mdash;down into the
olive orchards. Not a sound but the cooing of
pigeons and the far away tinkle of mule bells.
And then Mr. C. came, with his cigar in his mouth
and his black coat on, and talked about running a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
funicular up the mountain and having a first-class
hotel on the top. I couldn&rsquo;t speak. Coming to
earth with such a bump as that was too much for
me. He mistook my silence for something else,
and when I saw him take off his hat and remove
his cigar from his mouth, I knew what was coming.
I&rsquo;m afraid I was rather ruthless. If he hadn&rsquo;t
called me &lsquo;little girl&rsquo; I might have been kinder.
At any rate I fled back to Stephen who couldn&rsquo;t
climb the hill leading to the town; and left Mr.
Colebridge gazing into space. Probably planning
where the funicular should go. No, that&rsquo;s unfair.
Anyhow, I left him, and when he joined us
he was silent for once. I do like him, but marry
him&mdash;oh, no, no! He has made me fall in love
with all modest, shy men. With all poor, unlucky
men. With any one, in fact, who is sensitive and
perceptive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Success isn&rsquo;t attractive in itself. It has to be
offset by other attributes. It can&rsquo;t be good for
any one to own as many things as Mr. Colebridge
owns. A railroad, endless shares in companies,
factories, businesses, even theaters&mdash;no, he isn&rsquo;t
a Jew. He&rsquo;s terrific. I should be just a thing to
hang clothes on. He doesn&rsquo;t know anything
about me. I don&rsquo;t believe he knows what color
my eyes are.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
&ldquo;He has helped me to make up my mind about
Major Crosby, who has written me several charming
letters. I&rsquo;ve written him very nice ones in
return; as nice as I dared to write. And, oh,
Claire! What do you think Stephen means to
do? He means to settle something on me! I
don&rsquo;t know exactly how much. But think of it!
So that I can marry a poor man or no one at all,
just as I like. I can be independent. I can&rsquo;t
believe it yet. I think I shall marry Chip with
it, if what he tries not to say in his letters is true.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Colebridge is coming to London, about
the same time that I am. Business, he says. I
only hope he doesn&rsquo;t take the same train. I&rsquo;ve
been very definite, but his epidermis is thick. He
says he is anxious to meet you. One of the nice
things about him is that he admires Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by, Claire. I will see you soon. Thanks
to you and to Stephen, I feel that life is just beginning
for <ins title="Remove double right quote after me">me.</ins>
</p>
</div>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;Devotedly,</p>
<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Judy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Very satisfactory, thought Madame Claire.
No one wants gratitude&mdash;no one, except, perhaps,
a bully&mdash;but when one does get it, how it warms
the heart!
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Callous or not, she couldn&rsquo;t help hoping, like
Judy, that the murdered Italian might prove to
be Connie&rsquo;s entirely superfluous husband. No
other man, she felt, could so thoroughly deserve
to die such a death, if half the things Connie had
told of him were true. And Connie was not an
untruthful woman. He was too evil to live &hellip;
too evil to die, perhaps, but his fate in the next
world concerned her less than his activities in this.
</p>

<p>
Then one more letter from Stephen&mdash;the last,
he said, from Cannes. &ldquo;D.V.,&rdquo; murmured Madame
Claire as she read the words.
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you did for me when
you lent me Judy,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">he wrote.</span>
&ldquo;She has grown
very dear to me, and I have persuaded her, I
think, to let me settle something on her. As I
pointed out to her, if you had married me, as
she often says you ought to have done, she would
have been, to all practical purposes, my granddaughter.
My wants are simple, and I have only
my niece Monica and Miss McPherson to think
of, and they are already arranged for. Judy has
given me an added interest in life, and as I tell
her, I feel I&rsquo;m buying shares in the coming generation.
I have every faith in the company and
mean to be godfather to all the dividends. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
see I am taking it for granted that she will marry
the fellow she ran over. If she doesn&rsquo;t marry
him she will need some money of her own all the
more. The child says I have poured every good
gift into her lap!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, I wish I could come back with
her, but that tyrant McPherson says no. It will
not be long though, Claire, I promise you. I am
living on anticipation&mdash;unsatisfying fare. You
don&rsquo;t suppose, do you, that I shall have to go
on living on it? You don&rsquo;t suppose that anything
could happen to prevent it? What a worrying
old fool I am! Of course it can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie is a widow! Perhaps this is not breaking
it gently, but personally I think it is excellent
news. Chiozzi died from a stab over the heart.
He was motoring from Cannes to Monte Carlo
at night along the Upper Corniche Road in Mlle.
Pauline&rsquo;s car. That is all that is known. The
lady, her maid, her car and her chauffeur have
vanished. I think Judy prepared you for this.
Will you tell Connie? Perhaps she has already
heard through her solicitors in Paris. I don&rsquo;t
think she will grieve.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope that a telegram to say I am leaving
will be the next word you receive from me. Pray
that it may.
</p>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;Yours,</p>

        </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Judy</span>
reached London at ten o&rsquo;clock one night,
tired but in the best of spirits. She felt that she
was returning, thanks to Stephen, to a new life.
Eaton Square no longer seemed to her a prison.
Money had opened the doors of that solemn
house. Millie&rsquo;s powers of suppression and repression
had been lessened. Noel&rsquo;s departure for
Germany no longer hung over her like a tragedy.
What was there to prevent her going to see him
half way through that interminable year?
</p>

<p>
She felt that she had never appreciated money
before. It cut binding ropes like a knife. It gave
one seven league boots. A pair of wings, too.
People who belittled its powers were either hypocrites
or fools. Why did old people prefer to
make young people glad when they were dead
instead of glad while they were alive?
</p>

<p>
After helping to disentangle her luggage, Noel
took her back to the dark house in Eaton Square.
A light had been left burning half way up the
stairs, but Millie, as a protest against this trip
that she had never approved of&mdash;&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
though Mr. de Lisle were a relation,&rdquo; she had
frequently said&mdash;had gone early to bed, followed
by her obedient John.
</p>

<p>
The two crept up to Judy&rsquo;s room and talked
until nearly two. Noel heard all about Cannes
and about the people she had met there, including
Mr. Colebridge, whom he at once decided he
wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to London in a few days,&rdquo; said
Judy, &ldquo;so your wish may be granted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Finally he consented to talk about himself.
He had heard that afternoon that their departure
had been postponed and that they were not leaving
for a week&mdash;he and his chief with the ridiculous
name. He thought he was going to like the
job, and it was wonderful how his German was
beginning to come back to him at the very thought
of the journey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only drawback to the whole thing,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;is the feeling that I&rsquo;m leaving you to fight
your battles alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was the moment she had waited for. She
told him why she was not utterly dashed to earth
by his going. His delight was equal to her own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Stephen&rsquo;s an old
sportsman! I wish there were more like him.
I can hardly wait to tell him what I think of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Judy, with an income of her own! What will you
do with it besides coming to see me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hesitated, and then said flushing but meeting
his eyes courageously:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of marrying Chip with it,
Noel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wasn&rsquo;t altogether astonished, nor did he
pretend to be; but although he had discussed that
possibility with her more or less seriously before,
he felt he ought now point out its very obvious
drawbacks. It would mean an arduous life, with
few pleasures.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid to encourage you to do it,
old girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only I like him so much.
He may be a dreamer, and he may be unpractical,
and that book of his may not be worth the paper
it&rsquo;s written on, for all I know. But I do know
that he&rsquo;s one of the very best fellows I ever met.
One of the very best. And he&rsquo;s hard hit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful&mdash;this deciding,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
where Claire and Stephen have the advantage of
us. They can just live from day to day and take
what the gods bring. And if they don&rsquo;t bring
anything&mdash;well, they&rsquo;ve lived. But this not knowing
what to do with your life&mdash;this trying to
make the most of it and not knowing how&mdash;it&rsquo;s
hell, sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
&ldquo;Poor old Judy! &lsquo;Standing with reluctant
feet&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Is that it? But I know what you
mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you sure, are you
absolutely sure that Chip&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is hard hit? Good Lord! A baby could have
seen it. All the same you&rsquo;ll have your work cut
out for you. He&rsquo;s so terribly modest. He doesn&rsquo;t
seem to think that you or any other woman would
give him a thought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Later she remembered that she had news for
him, and wondered how she could have forgotten
it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel, I meant to have told you before. About
Chiozzi. You haven&rsquo;t heard, have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chiozzi? No. What about him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead. He was stabbed&mdash;by that pretty
dancer, Mlle. Pauline, they think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel looked concerned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst news I&rsquo;ve heard in a long
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The worst? What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most upsetting, in fact. Connie told me
the other day that Petrovitch&rsquo;s second wife, an
American, had just divorced him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well? I&rsquo;m not surprised at that.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you see? She&rsquo;ll marry Petrovitch
now, and be miserable forever after.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marry him?&rdquo; Judy was incredulous. &ldquo;She
wouldn&rsquo;t be such a fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ho! Wouldn&rsquo;t she? You don&rsquo;t know your
Aunt Constance as well as I do. And I won&rsquo;t
be here to prevent it. Hang it all! I wish
Chiozzi hadn&rsquo;t got himself done in just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not tell her,&rdquo; suggested Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good. She&rsquo;s probably heard from
her solicitors in Paris already. I haven&rsquo;t seen
her for two or three days. She&rsquo;s at Eastbourne
and won&rsquo;t be back till the day after to-morrow.
What&rsquo;s to be done now, I wonder? I never
guessed that a fallen aunt would be such a responsibility.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;suppose she does marry
Petrovitch. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a solution, in a
way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel&rsquo;s jaw looked uncompromisingly firm at
that moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the way I would like. Connie&rsquo;s a fool,
but she&rsquo;s not bad. Petrovitch is a brute. If she
marries him she&rsquo;s done for, for good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave it to Claire. She&rsquo;ll find a way to stop
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t. She can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve got more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
influence with Connie than anybody, but if she
sees a chance of marrying Petrovitch she won&rsquo;t
listen to me, even.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat for a moment lost in thought, then
looked at his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, this wants thinking out. Get to bed,
Judy. You&rsquo;re dead tired. I hope they&rsquo;re pleasant
to you at breakfast. They seemed to think
you had no right to go away and enjoy yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will they say when they hear I&rsquo;ve accepted
this settlement from Stephen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You leave them to me,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Judy kissed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good night, you wonderfullest of brothers!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb hide">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
Three days later, Judy was at Madame Claire&rsquo;s
when Mr. Colebridge was announced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d come,&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
He came, looking exactly as he had looked at
Cannes. His heavy and rather expressionless
face never lost its look of solemn imperturbability.
No smile disturbed his features at sight
of Judy, though he could not have known he
would meet her there. Madame Claire extended
a hand with lace at the wrist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Colebridge! How nice of you to come
and see an old lady! I&rsquo;ve heard so much about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
you from Mr. de Lisle and my granddaughter
that I feel I know you quite well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real kind of you to welcome me like this.&rdquo;
He turned to Judy. &ldquo;Well, Miss Pendleton, I&rsquo;m
glad to see you got here safe and sound. Cannes
seemed sorter dead after you left it, so I made
up my mind to pull up stakes and quit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you had to come on business,&rdquo; she reminded
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. There&rsquo;s a lot of different kinds
of business. Seems as if I kinder knew you too,
Lady Gregory. Say, I&rsquo;m just cracked about that
old Mr. de Lisle. He sure is a fine old gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s rather nice,&rdquo; agreed Madame
Claire. &ldquo;You saw him the most recently. Tell
us how he was?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just living for the day when he can get back
here. But improving right along. I said to him,
&lsquo;Mr. de Lisle,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll pine away if
you don&rsquo;t get to London soon.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s just
what he&rsquo;d do. He&rsquo;d pine away. Mind if I smoke
a cigar, Lady Gregory?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no. Do smoke. You were very kind to
him and to Judy there. She&rsquo;s told me about the
delightful trips you took.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, say, it was a pleasure. I don&rsquo;t take
much stock in scenery. I like to have folks to
talk to. Maybe we can take some rides around
London later on, Miss Pendleton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy was surprised. Surely she had made herself
clear. Or was it that he merely wished
to continue friendly relations? She replied evasively,
and Madame Claire changed the subject
for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long will you be in London?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A matter of six months or so, I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder. I&rsquo;m not figuring on going back just yet.
We&rsquo;ve got some factories over here that I want
to look into, and I may run over to Paris later
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know London at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but my chauffeur does, so I don&rsquo;t worry.
I picked up an English chauffeur in Cannes, Miss
Pendleton. The French fellow I had wouldn&rsquo;t
leave his wife and family, and anyway, he didn&rsquo;t
speak any language that I could understand. But
with this English chauffeur, if I listen real carefully,
I can pick up a word now and then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They laughed at this. Madame Claire felt
that she was going to enjoy Mr. Colebridge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to be interested in a great many
things,&rdquo; she remarked presently. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
understand Judy to say that the theater was one
of <ins title="Change single right quote to double right quote after them?">them?&rdquo;</ins>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only from a business point of view,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t claim to know anything about
the stage. But when I see that a certain theater
is about to go smash because it&rsquo;s been managed
by a lot of bone-heads, why, I don&rsquo;t mind lending
a hand. I practically own one in New York, and
one in Cincinnati. There&rsquo;s another one in New
York that looks like getting into difficulties pretty
soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! And then you step in. But does that
mean that you can put on certain plays, and have
an actual voice in the production of them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t concern myself much with that
side of it. I don&rsquo;t know a good play from a bad
one. I like a good lively show now and then.
But if I wanted a certain play put on, I&rsquo;d get it
put on, all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy wondered why it was that financial weight
and an understanding of the arts so seldom went
hand in hand. Madame Claire pursued a line of
thought of her own for a moment or two while
Mr. Colebridge enlarged upon his powers.
</p>

<p>
And then, most unexpectedly, Dawson opened
the door and announced Major Crosby.
</p>

<p>
How strange that those two men should meet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
thought Judy! She remembered telling Claire
in one of her letters that it was impossible to
imagine two men less alike. And now that she
saw them together she knew that what she had
said was true.
</p>

<p>
Major Crosby was introduced to Mr. Colebridge,
who was pleased to make his acquaintance,
and Madame Claire ordered tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a wonderful afternoon for me,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often have so many visitors. It&rsquo;s
very exciting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It didn&rsquo;t take Chip more than a second or two
to place the other caller. Judy had mentioned
an American she had met in Cannes, and lo!
Here he was. She had only been home two or
three days. He hadn&rsquo;t waited very long before
following after. Judy tried to talk to him, but
Mr. Colebridge had the floor and meant to keep
it. Chip retired into his shell&mdash;that haven of
refuge from which he seldom advanced very far
in company&mdash;and contented himself with looking
and listening. He looked chiefly at Judy. She
was looking very lovely, he thought. No wonder
that people followed her from Cannes to London.
Powerful, authoritative-looking people, who
booked large outside cabins on ocean liners as a
matter of course, and always gravitated to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
most expensive hotels. What a fool he had been!
This man could give her everything. Why not, as
he seemed to own it? What was he saying?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I told them I wasn&rsquo;t having any. I told
them I had all the irons in the fire I wanted. It
was a good thing all right, but say, what&rsquo;s the
good of any more money to me? I&rsquo;ve got all I
want right now. And if I ever do make any more,
it will be just to turn it over to my wife if I&rsquo;ve
got one&rdquo;&mdash;he looked straight at Judy as he said
it&mdash;&ldquo;and say, &lsquo;There you are. It&rsquo;s yours to do as
you like with. Throw it away, spend it, it&rsquo;s all
the same to me. So long as you have a good
time with it, and it makes you happy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And of course it will,&rdquo; said Judy with faint
sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure it will,&rdquo; he agreed, taking her words
at their face value. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s what every
woman wants. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Lady Gregory?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire regarded him seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never can tell, Mr. Colebridge,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Women are the most unaccountable creatures.
Sometimes it takes more than money to make
them happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Mr. Colebridge defended the sex,
&ldquo;when it comes to unreasonableness, I guess men
aren&rsquo;t all reasonable either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Judy glanced at Chip, hoping to catch a twinkle
of amusement in his eye, but he was looking at
Mr. Colebridge.
</p>

<p>
Chip stayed for an hour or more, saying very
little, seeming to prefer listening to talking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You make me such very short visits,&rdquo; complained
Madame Claire when he got up to go.
&ldquo;I hardly have time to say five words to you before
you&rsquo;re off again. But perhaps you&rsquo;ll pay me
another visit soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My plans are rather unsettled just now,&rdquo; said
Chip vaguely. &ldquo;May I ring you up one day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned to Judy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she asked as she took his hand,
&ldquo;are you <ins title="Change prefectly to perfectly">perfectly</ins>
well again? No more of
those headaches?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m as well as ever, thank you. I&rsquo;ve
almost forgotten that it ever happened&mdash;I mean
as far as the injuries are concerned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy smiled at him, sorry because she knew he
felt he had said something stupid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel wants to see you, too. We must meet
again soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to see him. I&rsquo;ll write. It&rsquo;s just possible
that I may go away soon, but I&rsquo;ll let you
know.&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
He said good-by to Mr. Colebridge, who shook
him by the hand, and in a moment he was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could anything,&rdquo; Judy asked herself, &ldquo;be
more unsatisfactory?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stayed half an hour longer, hoping for a
few words alone with Madame Claire, but as Mr.
Colebridge made no move she presently got up
to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by, Claire, dear. Let me know the
moment you get a wire from Stephen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Colebridge also rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My car&rsquo;s outside,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I trust you&rsquo;ll
allow me to drop you at your home, Miss Pendleton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was about to refuse on the grounds that
she wanted a walk, but thought better of it. It
would be a good opportunity for a few words
with him. She kissed Madame Claire, and Mr.
Colebridge, after announcing his intention of
coming again soon, followed her out.
</p>

<p>
The same car, a different chauffeur, and very
different surroundings. Mr. Colebridge, however,
was as unchanged as his car.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lovely old lady,&rdquo; he remarked as
they left the hotel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we can sorter meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
there often. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, Miss Pendleton,
that when I say I&rsquo;m here on business, that
business is partly you. I don&rsquo;t get easily cast
down. I kinder bob up again. Now,&rdquo; he went
on as she tried to interrupt, &ldquo;I hope, little girl,
that you&rsquo;re going to reconsider. I&rsquo;m here to try
to persuade you to reconsider.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite out of the question, Mr. Colebridge.
I told you so before. Do, please, believe me this
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that voice of yours that gets me,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a hit in America, all
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hopeless!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I simply
don&rsquo;t understand American men. But perhaps
they&rsquo;re not all like you. You won&rsquo;t <em>learn</em> anything!
It&rsquo;s like &hellip; it&rsquo;s like trying to teach an
elephant to dance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead. Don&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, I will. The trouble with you is,
you&rsquo;ve no diffidence. You&rsquo;ve never tried to see
yourself as others see you. You&rsquo;re just Mr.
Whitman Colebridge of Cincinnati&mdash;wherever
that is&mdash;and you&rsquo;re worth I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t
care how much, and as far as you&rsquo;re concerned,
that&rsquo;s enough. You&rsquo;ve never asked yourself if
you lack anything. You&rsquo;re perfectly satisfied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
yourself as you are. Perfectly. Isn&rsquo;t that true?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He considered this, studying the end of a fresh
cigar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m any worse
than the general run.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. You don&rsquo;t see. You don&rsquo;t see anything
that isn&rsquo;t business. You&rsquo;ve gone through life like
a rocket, with a good deal of noise and a lot of
speed, and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no harm in a rocket,&rdquo; he said
easily. &ldquo;It gives people something to look at,
and it&rsquo;s real pretty when it bursts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy laughed helplessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps if you&rsquo;d do the same I might like
you better. But at present you&rsquo;re so swollen with
success that you&rsquo;re intolerable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bully for you! That was straight from the
shoulder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the good of it? It goes in one
ear and out the other. Well, here&rsquo;s something
that will stick, perhaps. You met a Major Crosby
at my grandmother&rsquo;s this afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That his name? Quiet sorter fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going to marry him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She watched his face and saw that not a muscle
of it changed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That so? I guessed there must be some one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Well, you won&rsquo;t hear me squeal. You&rsquo;ve been
fair and square with me, and I guess I can take
my medicine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m beginning to like you better. I&rsquo;ve
liked some things about you all the time, even
when you irritated me most. I&rsquo;m sorry we can&rsquo;t
be friends, but I see that&rsquo;s out of the question
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. I&rsquo;ll just stick around for
a while and see what happens, anyhow. You&rsquo;re
the first woman who&rsquo;s ever taken enough interest
in me to criticize me, and I think it&rsquo;s a hopeful
sign. You engaged to that fellow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They had reached the house in Eaton Square.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, shaking hands with him, &ldquo;I
prefer not to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he answered, returning to the car,
&ldquo;I just kinder thought I&rsquo;d ask.&rdquo;
</p>

knocked on Noel&rsquo;s bedroom door before
dinner the following evening, and was invited to
enter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Noel, who was sorting
ties and socks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she answered, displaying a letter.
&ldquo;The most disgusting thing&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it? It looks like Chip&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is. I told you he called on Claire yesterday
when I was there, and met Mr. Colebridge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he seems to have jumped to conclusions.
Listen to this. I&rsquo;ll read it to you.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Miss Pendleton,</p>

<div class="letter-body">
<p class="epubmaker-bquote-hack1">
&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I told you about a cottage my
mother owned in Cornwall. It&rsquo;s a very remote,
quiet little place, and I&rsquo;ve found it very useful at
different times. I think it will exactly suit my
present mood, and I&rsquo;m going down there by an
early train to-morrow. I hope to be able to finish
the book there. I don&rsquo;t seem to have been able to
get on with it lately.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to thank you again for all your kindness
to me, kindness that few people would have
shown to a careless individual who got in the
way of their car. I shall never forget it. There
was a time&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she broke off, &ldquo;he goes on to say
something about having been foolish enough to
hope something or other&mdash;I&rsquo;ll skip that. Then:
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I think that your days of freedom and happiness
are just beginning, and I hope with all my
heart that you may find in your marriage all that
you have so far missed in life. You will be marrying
a man who can give you everything&mdash;all the
good things that are so obviously yours by right.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you say good-by to your brother for
me? He has given me his address in Germany,
and I mean to write to him there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;This is a stupid, stilted letter, but I feel confident
that you will understand the much that it
fails to say, and forgive it its shortcomings.
</p>
</div>

<p class="complimentary-closing">&ldquo;&lsquo;Always yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;&lsquo;Andrew Crosby.<ins
title="change closing right double quote to a single quote">&rsquo;</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Dated yesterday,&rdquo; she added. She put the
letter back into its envelope. &ldquo;He must have
left for Cornwall early this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel whistled.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
&ldquo;Mr. Colebridge must have been a bit forthcoming
yesterday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forthcoming isn&rsquo;t the word for it. He talked
about the money he would give his wife, and
looked straight at me&mdash;oh, isn&rsquo;t it maddening!
I wouldn&rsquo;t have had this happen for anything!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you told Claire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I took the letter there as soon as it
came.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good deal, but I don&rsquo;t see how I can possibly
act on her advice. She says that if I don&rsquo;t
go to Cornwall and straighten things out with
him, I&rsquo;m a fool. She has a horror of misunderstandings.
She begged me to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, hang it all! You can&rsquo;t go alone. If it
weren&rsquo;t for this German trip, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke
off, frowning. &ldquo;So she thinks you ought to go
down there?&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was most emphatic about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;what day is to-day? By Jove,
Judy! There&rsquo;s time if we go to-morrow. What
do you say? Shall we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Noel! I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I do
want to talk to him. I couldn&rsquo;t write anything&mdash;that
would mean anything. I&rsquo;d have to see
him. What do you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
&ldquo;I think old Claire&rsquo;s pretty generally right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then&mdash;shall we go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready if you are,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to see old Chip again myself. It means the ten-thirty
from Paddington, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will the family say?&rdquo; Judy asked him.
&ldquo;Oh, well, let them say it! I knew I could count
on you, Noel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
Once in the swift and inexorable train, Judy
was assailed with doubts. What was she doing?
Should she have let things take their own course?
Would it have been wiser to have stayed at home,
and to have written Chip a letter?
</p>

<p>
Noel, observing her restlessness and guessing
the cause, told her he had won five pounds at
bridge the day before, and that if she wanted to
pull the emergency cord and get out, he&rsquo;d pay.
But when she asked him point blank, &ldquo;Tell me,
do you think I&rsquo;m acting like a fool?&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;No, like a human being,&rdquo; and she felt calmer
then and read her magazine.
</p>

<p>
But panic overwhelmed her once more in the
jolting Ford with flapping side curtains that took
them from the inn in West Perranpool to Cliff
Cottage, where Chip lived.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did we come?&rdquo; she cried.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Noel, the comforter, &ldquo;I wanted
to see Chip again before I went to Germany,
and I brought you with me. And besides, I saw
his doctor again the other day, and he said that
what Chip needed more than anything was cheering
up. He said he&rsquo;d been rather depressed since
the accident. So stop agonizing about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stopped agonizing after that, and watched
the thin rain of early spring that slanted steadily
down from a darkening sky. The bleak landscape
had a peculiar charm. So, too, had the lonely,
white cottages they passed, their undrawn curtains
showing fiery painted walls, for dusk was
upon them. They climbed a little hill and pulled
up sharply at the door of a low house that looked
at the sea from its dormer windows. Lights
burned there, too. The driver of the Ford had
assured them that Major Crosby would be in,
because, he said, there was never anything to go
out for. They told him to wait, and knocked
at the door.
</p>

<p>
Chip opened it himself. It was just dark
enough to make it difficult for him to recognize
them, but when he did he was almost overcome
with surprise and pleasure. He stammered. He
shook hands twice over. He shut the door too
quickly behind them&mdash;as though, Judy thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
he were afraid they might go out again&mdash;and
caught her skirt in it, at which they all laughed.
He pushed every chair in the room toward the
fire, as if they were capable of sitting in more
than one apiece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is glorious!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can hardly
believe it! I never dreamed of it. You must
stay to supper. No, I&rsquo;m not my own cook; I&rsquo;d
starve if I were. There&rsquo;s a Cornish char here
somewhere. I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rushed off, and they heard him giving excited
and confused directions in the kitchen. Then
he rushed back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to send the car away. It&rsquo;s only a
mile to the inn. I&rsquo;ll walk back with you after
supper. You&rsquo;re angels from heaven, both of you.
There&rsquo;s only fish and eggs and cheese. Can you
bear that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Judy saw a new Chip&mdash;a happy, hopeful one.
Excitement and wholly unexpected pleasure gave
him confidence. He asked a hundred questions.
He made Judy take off her hat and coat and carried
them away into his room. He replenished
the fire and hurled into it some papers that had
been lying on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was trying to write a letter,&rdquo; he explained.
Judy thought she saw her name on a blackening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
sheet before it puffed into flame. Another letter,
to her? Was he dissatisfied, perhaps, with the
letter he had written her before leaving London?
How little he had guessed, while writing it, that
he would be interrupted half way through it, and
by her. His eyes shone, and his undisciplined
hair stood up at the back like a schoolboy&rsquo;s. He
didn&rsquo;t know or care. He was happy.
</p>

<p>
There in that cottage room, Judy felt the influence
of the woman who had furnished it. She
had put into it all the little personal odds and
ends that she had loved. There was her work
table, there her favorite chair. There was the
writing table where she had sat penning the novels
that had educated her son. Novels, Chip had
said, that she would have hated. But he was
wrong. There, on the mantelpiece with its
tasseled, red velvet draping, were pictures of Chip
as a baby, as a schoolboy, as a youth at Sandhurst,
where he had acquired that absurd nickname
of his, and as a First Lieutenant about to
take his part in the South African war, from
which campaign he had returned to find her gone.
He had left everything as she had left it, and
Judy was disposed to love him for it. Books
were scattered about the room, and it had the air
of being much lived in and much worked in.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
It was easy enough for him to talk to-day. His
reserve seemed to have melted away from him.
Had he heard anything more from Helen about
meeting influential people, Judy asked? No, he
hadn&rsquo;t. She had forgotten all about it, no doubt.
He was rather relieved that she had.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People have no time for failures,&rdquo; Chip said,
&ldquo;and quite right too. A man who has reached
the age of forty-four without accomplishing anything
is a failure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tosh!&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;Every one&rsquo;s a
failure at some time of their lives. The thing
is to see that it isn&rsquo;t chronic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old Cornish woman came in and laid the
table for supper, bringing with her an extra lamp.
She seemed very pleased that the Major had
company, and looked approvingly at Judy. They
sat down presently to a savory meal, and she
waited on them with enthusiasm, putting in a
word now and then.
</p>

<p>
Chip talked of the country round about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you happen to
like these rather bleak and open places. I do,
myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Judy. &ldquo;But I love trees,
too; although I think treeless places are better
for one. I always imagine I can think better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
where there aren&rsquo;t many trees. Perhaps they have
thoughts of their own, and they get mixed up with
our thoughts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, one can think here,&rdquo; Chip said. &ldquo;There
are some fine walks, too. I&rsquo;ll take you for a walk
over the cliffs to-morrow, if it&rsquo;s not too cold and
windy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come over after breakfast,&rdquo; said Noel.
&ldquo;You might walk half way and meet us, Chip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; he exclaimed with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
start out at about half-past nine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After supper they sat by the fire and talked
until Judy grew so sleepy that she said she&rsquo;d
never be able to get to the inn if they didn&rsquo;t start
at once.
</p>

<p>
When they went out they found it had stopped
raining, but there was a high wind blowing. It
roared high up over their heads most of the time,
every now and then swooping down upon them
and shaking their clothes, then going crazily off
to roar above their heads again. The moon
looked out occasionally through gaps in the flying
clouds. A wild night that made the blood go
faster. The road was rough and stony and in
order to be guided better, Judy passed one arm
through Chip&rsquo;s and the other through Noel&rsquo;s, and
they walked abreast. She felt Chip straighten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
suddenly when she put her arm through his, and
for some moments he walked without speaking,
holding her arm rigidly as though he were abnormally
conscious of her touch.
</p>

<p>
He said good night to them at the door of the
inn&mdash;a mere whitewashed cottage, much added
on to&mdash;and Judy marveled at the change in his
face when the light fell on it from the open door&mdash;the
change wrought in it by a few hours of
happiness. It seemed to her that it was a different
being who had stared out at them from his
own door earlier that evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said for the third time. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t try to thank you for coming. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And he vanished abruptly into the darkness.
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The question before the house,&rdquo; said Noel
the next morning at breakfast, &ldquo;is this: how am
I going to lose myself to-day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Judy in a panic at the thought.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to, Noel. Please don&rsquo;t leave me.
I&rsquo;ve quite changed my mind. I think it&rsquo;s much
better to let things take their own course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, let them,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;All I mean
to do is to clear the course a bit. It&rsquo;s going to be
rather difficult. I think I&rsquo;d better leave it to the
inspiration of the moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
He said no more about it, and promptly at
half-past nine they left the inn together and made
their way toward Cliff Cottage. They had gone
less than half way, however, when they met Chip
walking toward them with long strides.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Did you
sleep well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We never slept better,&rdquo; answered Judy, &ldquo;and
I feel as if I could walk twenty miles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Noel, &ldquo;but all the walking I
shall do this morning will be to the post office
and back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; exclaimed the other two.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my own fault. I never sent the Chief
word that I wouldn&rsquo;t be in town to-day. Clean
forgot it. I&rsquo;ll send him a wire to say what time
I&rsquo;ll be back to-morrow. Then I must write one
or two letters I won&rsquo;t have another chance to
write before I go off on Thursday. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll
meet you at the inn at one. You&rsquo;re lunching
with us to-day, Chip. Well,&rdquo; as he turned to
leave them, &ldquo;have a good walk. So long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They stood watching his thin, upright figure.
That empty sleeve of his, tucked into the pocket
of his coat, did not affect his easy, swinging walk.
He ignored it himself so utterly that he made
other people ignore it too. They waited until he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
looked back and waved at them, and then they
started on their way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I almost believed him myself,&rdquo; thought Judy,
admiring the ease with which he had taken himself
off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your brother Noel,&rdquo; said Chip, &ldquo;is the best
fellow I&rsquo;ve ever known.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Appreciation of Noel always touched Judy to
the quick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how that pleases me!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you feel that. There&rsquo;s no
one like him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are like him,&rdquo; said Chip quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I were more like him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a while they walked on without speaking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chip,&rdquo; said Judy at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call
you that. I have for a long time in my own
mind and to Noel. Please treat me like an old
friend and tell me about yourself and your plans.
Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be reserved with each other. There&rsquo;s
so much I want to know about you. I promise
you there&rsquo;s nothing I would hesitate to tell you
about myself, and I wish you would feel that
you could discuss anything with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They still had with them the high wind of the
night before. It was fresh and bracing, but not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
cold, and it carried with it a smell of the sea and
of the turf, wet with yesterday&rsquo;s rain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me, then. What do you mean to do
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Finish the book, first of all. Beyond that
I&rsquo;ve no plans at all. The worst of it is, I&rsquo;ve
rather lost faith in it lately. I suppose one is
apt to feel like that, after working on a thing
for twelve years. Now that it&rsquo;s nearly done, I
want to chuck the whole blessed thing into the
fire. It would give me a queer sort of satisfaction
to see it burn. Remorse and despair would follow,
of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kindly resist any such impulse,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t give in to it, I promise you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wrong for you to live alone as you
do,&rdquo; Judy told him. &ldquo;Only people who are very
socially inclined ought to live alone, for they&rsquo;d
take good care not to be alone any more than
they could help. I think loneliness is paralyzing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe it is,&rdquo; he agreed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well then. You must stop living this
hermit&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said smiling, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t as easy as it
sounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fairly easy, I think. You must marry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chip had no reply to make to that for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
time. They walked on, along a path that bordered
the turfy cliff. The sea, its grayness
whipped by the wind into lines of white foam
that advanced and retreated, was worrying the
rocks below them. Gulls flashed silver white
against a low and frowning sky. The day suited
her mood. She felt bold, braced by the wind and
the sea. The high cliffs gave her courage. The
space gave her freedom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For that,&rdquo; Chip said at last, &ldquo;two things are
necessary. The first is love; the second is the
means to keep that love from perishing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Once you possess the first,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;you
have more power to gain the second.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t possess it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean that you have never loved any
one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that no one does or could care for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you hadn&rsquo;t said that,&rdquo; she told him,
turning her head to meet his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? It&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t the truth. Besides, no man ought
to be as humble as that. It&rsquo;s all wrong. You
have never tried to make any one love you. Have
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then how can you possibly know?&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
&ldquo;I have no right to try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As much right as any other man. More than
most.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no! You don&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;re forgetting
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; interrupted Judy, &ldquo;how many
other men and women have had this same argument?
The woman putting love first, the man
money. Or vice versa. You, evidently, put money
first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was more than he could bear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;Say that
I put love first, every time, and that I would
sacrifice everything for it and to it, rather than
do it less than justice. A man has no right to
snatch at love, regardless of the consequences.
To put it first is sometimes the supremest selfishness.
It&rsquo;s putting oneself first, one&rsquo;s own gain
and good first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly right, Chip,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re right. Only, if by putting it first
you were adding to some one else&rsquo;s happiness &hellip;
instead of taking away from it &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She saw his lips tighten.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am only hurting him,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It
would be better to speak out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chip,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I want to talk to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
you about your letter. The one you wrote before
coming down here. You evidently took it for
granted I was going to marry Mr. Colebridge,
and that soon. Don&rsquo;t you think you rather jumped
to conclusions? Because I&rsquo;ve no intention of marrying
Mr. Colebridge, now or later. What made
you think I had?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there he was&mdash;rich, successful, influential.
A man of standing and power &hellip; and in
love with you &hellip; as any one could see. He
had followed you from the South of France &hellip;
you were together at Lady Gregory&rsquo;s &hellip; it all
seemed so perfectly natural &hellip; and suitable &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think it would have been suitable?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From a worldly point of view, yes. Though
I prefer not to say what was going on in my
mind.&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you think my point of view is a wholly
worldly one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never said that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You practically did. You must have thought
it. I thought you knew me better than that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw no reason to suppose that you would
have chosen him merely from worldly motives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
I judged him to be kind, generous, honest&mdash;a
man a woman might be very fond of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What sort of a woman? My sort?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t argue about it. I accepted it. There
it was. I believed you had decided to marry him.
I knew that if you had done so, you must have
had good reasons for it. I was prepared to believe
you were acting for &hellip; for the best.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What else was going on in your mind as you
sat there? You were very quiet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would rather not say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You understand that I am not going to marry
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do, and I&mdash;selfishly and unreasonably&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t help being thankful. That&rsquo;s only human, I
suppose. But even if I had known it that day,
I think I would have made up my mind to come
here just the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you must know why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Very gently and quietly said. One might speak
so to a child who asks foolish and tactless questions.
Oh, Claire! It&rsquo;s all very well, thought
Judy, to say, have it out with him, but what would
you do yourself, if you were gently put aside like
that, and chidden a little? &ldquo;I think you must
know why.&rdquo; As if to say, &ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
no more about it.&rdquo; Claire had spoken as if it
were going to be the easiest thing in the world
to have it out with him!&hellip;
</p>

<p>
They rounded a curve in the path then and
Judy cried out at the beauty of the view. Far
below them the sea pounded and foamed. The
cliffs fell away with a sheer drop that gave her
an uneasy sensation of falling, for an instant, and
the wind buffeted them with such violence that
Chip took her by the arm and drew her back from
the path that ran dangerously close to the edge.
For a moment, speech was impossible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we sit somewhere,&rdquo; she cried, when
she could get her breath, &ldquo;out of the wind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He pointed to a great bowlder that overhung
the path a dozen yards ahead, and they struggled
toward it and crept into its shelter. There the
wind rushed by them but did not disturb them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can talk now
without shouting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I can smoke,&rdquo; said Chip, filling a pipe,
&ldquo;which is a great help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said a few minutes ago,&rdquo; she told him
quietly, &ldquo;that there was nothing I would hesitate
to tell you about myself. I mean to prove, now,
that I&rsquo;m as good as my word. I can&rsquo;t see that
we gain anything by &hellip; not speaking out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
each other. We&rsquo;re both very inclined to be reserved,
and to-day &hellip; to-day that sort of thing
seems to me very petty and artificial.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned and looked at her, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You could never be either petty or artificial.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I could. I have been. But I don&rsquo;t mean
to be so with you. What will you think of me,
Chip, if I tell you that I know &hellip; yes, I know &hellip;
that you need me &hellip; badly, and that I believe
&hellip; I know &hellip; that I need you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her voice was unsteady, in spite of her courage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he answered in a low voice, &ldquo;that
it is your divine kindness that makes you say that
to me. I think you say it because you know well
enough that there&rsquo;s nothing on earth I would
rather hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But he did not dare to look at her, and stared
out at the sea with his pipe between his teeth.
</p>

<p>
Judy laughed. A rather helpless laugh, with
something of exasperation in it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kindness! Oh, no. It&rsquo;s not that at all. I&rsquo;ll
tell you what it is. I&rsquo;m telling you this because
I&rsquo;m one of those women who are possessed of an
insatiable vanity. I&rsquo;m trying to make you say
things of the same sort to me. I exact it from
every man. I like being made love to, on general
principles. I took the trouble to come down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Cornwall to see you because I hoped to sit with
you under this rock and be made love to. Do
you believe me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s quite as true as that I said what I
did just now out of kindness. Kindness! I &hellip;
I could shake you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His face was very troubled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that I cannot&mdash;I dare not&mdash;put
any other interpretation on it? You still feel
an interest in the man who nearly fell under
your wheels that night. You want to know that
he is not &hellip; not too unhappy. You want to
leave him feeling that he can count on your friendship&mdash;and
he does, and will. And that is all. It
is a great deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you are the most annoying, insulting,
irritating of men! I don&rsquo;t know why I came all
this way to see you and talk to you &hellip; except
that I had to, Chip. Do you hear me? I had to!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; he said, looking at her with eyes that
seemed not to see her, &ldquo;I am perfectly certain
of one thing. And that is, that if by some miracle
you could, that you must not &hellip; you must not &hellip;
care for me. But you cannot, you cannot!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put out his hand toward her, gropingly,
and she took it.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
&ldquo;And I am equally certain of one thing, and
that is that you care for me. And I tell you,
Chip, I don&rsquo;t care twopence for your self-respect,
or whatever you call it, that you think so much of.
And I care even less for my own, at the moment.
And I am tired of your loneliness&mdash;your awful
loneliness&mdash;and I am tired to death of my own
loneliness. And I am tired of hearing you call
yourself a failure, and I am frightened of being
a failure myself&mdash;and only you can save me from
it. Only you! And if you talk any more nonsense
about my kindness now &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice that was like a
warning. &ldquo;Judy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve done a dreadful thing. I know I
have. And I don&rsquo;t care. I want you to tell me
all the things you haven&rsquo;t dared to tell me yet.
I want to hear them all &hellip; now. Are you going
to tell me, Chip? Are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was half frightened when she saw the look
of exaltation on his face. It was his great&mdash;his
supreme moment. The moment that comes once
to nearly every man, of awe and ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God forgive me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Connie,</span>
of late, had been giving much thought
to Petrovitch.
</p>

<p>
That gentleman was well aware that she
avoided seeing him because her nephew had persuaded
her to do so, and he was not pleased.
There were other things that did not please him.
His concerts had been less successful than they
should have been&mdash;was it possible that his popularity
was on the wane?&mdash;and his wealthy American
wife, who, up till now, had been very prodigal
with her money, had just obtained a divorce from
him. He had believed all along that she would
relent. However, the thing that most seriously
disquieted him was the unsatisfactory condition of
the box office returns. He accused his manager
of failing to advertise. He said unkind things of
the British public. He said there wasn&rsquo;t a decent
hall in London, from the point of view of acoustics,
and lastly he claimed that the food offered
to him at the many houses where he was entertained,
was abominable, and was ruining his digestion.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
He began writing letters to Connie, accusing
her, tenderly and regretfully, of faithlessness. He
wrote in French, as that language enabled him
to use the endearing &ldquo;tu&rdquo; that Connie, he knew
of old, found irresistible. As she had made no
promises concerning letters, she felt free to exchange
them with him as frequently as she desired.
</p>


<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;I am now,&rdquo; <span class="narration-of-letter">he
wrote her one day,</span> &ldquo;a free
man. My wife has seen fit to divorce me, and I
do not regret it. Like most American and English
women (to this rule, you, my beautiful Connie,
are a notable exception) she must have her
husband tied to her apron string. He must have
no existence of his own. I&mdash;I with my talents,
my work that is my life, I, if you please, must
remain in America at her side! She could not
share me with the world. It is not enough for her
that she is the wife of Illiodor Petrovitch. He
must be a tame bear to perform tricks for her.
Ah, Connie, you understood! You, and only you,
are a fit companion for a man like myself, a man
who cannot, who must not, even when he would,
be put in chains. Yet even you chained me once,
but only with your love. And I worshiped those
chains. I would have bound them round me the
more closely, but my work was a cruel master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
and bade me leave you, and though my heart
broke, I obeyed. Yet, knowing this, knowing
that all my life I have regretted those sweet
chains and longed for them again, knowing this,
you keep aloof. You refuse to see me. You
permit me to suffer at your hands. Why? Tell
me why, my beautiful Connie? You are not indifferent
to me. You were moved that first day.
I saw all that. Well then, why?&rdquo;
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
He wrote many such letters, and she answered
them, and told him of promises made to her relations,
of obligations. She never mentioned Noel.
She said that life was very cruel, and that she
did not want to hurt him. He would never know,
she said, what it cost her to refuse to see him.
</p>

<p>
When she wrote him of Chiozzi&rsquo;s sudden end,
he at once saw the finger of fate. They were both
free. Here was the advertising he needed. In
these days of vulgar competition such means were
not to be despised. He would marry Connie.
That old affair of theirs would be resurrected.
So much the better. A romance if you like. Connie
was now a Countess, and that also was to the
good. The papers would seize upon it with joy.
The news would travel before him to America
and pave the way for his next concert tour there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
His late wife would be chagrined at this
speedy remarriage. Everything was for the best.
</p>

<p>
He wrote Connie an impassioned letter. He
said that he lived but to make her his wife. That
he longed to make up to her for any injustice his
duty might have forced him to do her in the past.
The way was clear now. It was written. He laid
his name, his fame, the devotion of a lifetime, at
her feet.
</p>

<p>
Connie was not of the stuff that could resist
such an appeal. She was dazzled. Like many
women who have once dispensed with the formality
of marriage, she had an almost superstitious
respect for it. It would reinstate her in
the eyes of the world. It would prove that old
affair to have been indeed a great love. Illiodor
would never leave her again. They would grow
old together. Not even Noel could raise the faintest
objection to anything so peculiarly respectable.
</p>

<p>
Judy and Noel returned from Cornwall on the
night train, and on Wednesday morning&mdash;they
had been gone since Monday&mdash;Noel, fearing the
worst, went straight to Connie and found that
events had shaped themselves exactly as he had
anticipated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie,&rdquo; he told Judy later, &ldquo;looked like a
cat who has eaten the canary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
When Noel was very angry he was very concise,
and he was now in a very fine anger indeed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you made no
promises about letters. What you promised me
was to have nothing further to do with him.
When you gave me your word to give him up, it
meant just that. You did not give him up. You
corresponded with him secretly. I thought you
still had a spark of loyalty in you. I counted on
that. It was my mistake. If you want to go to
the devil, you may.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He picked up his hat. Connie, who had subsided
into a chair, gave a wail of dismay, and
running to the door put her back against it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noel! What do you mean? You can&rsquo;t go
away and leave me like this. I thought&mdash;I
thought you would be&mdash;well, if not exactly
pleased, at least reconciled. He is going to marry
me. We are both free now. It was wrong of
me to write to him. I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the
time, but I do now. I am sorry!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel stood looking at her as she leaned against
the door. Was she worth making further efforts
for? Poor old Connie! She would go to the
devil now and no mistake! Those pretty, pale
blue eyes and that weak mouth had defeated
him.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to be said,&rdquo; he replied
more gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made your choice. I&rsquo;m
leaving for Germany to-morrow, as you know.
So, good-by, Connie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tears again. She wouldn&rsquo;t take his hand but
clung instead to his arm, sobbing. There was a
knock at the door. Noel opened it, expecting to
see Petrovitch. But it was Madame Claire.
</p>

<p>
She stood there smiling, observing Connie&rsquo;s
tears and Noel&rsquo;s anger. She leaned with one
hand upon her ebony stick. With the other hand
she held about her the folds of a long, fur-trimmed
cape.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Claire!&rdquo; exclaimed Noel. &ldquo;You out, and at
this time of day? This is marvelous!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&rdquo;I wanted to see Connie,&rdquo; said Madame Claire,
kissing her daughter on the cheek. &ldquo;Good morning,
my dear. I hope you are properly flattered
at such a visit. I don&rsquo;t often get out as early as
this. In fact I don&rsquo;t often get out at all, these
days. Were you going, Noel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Connie has just informed
me of her approaching nuptials. I&rsquo;ll
leave the congratulations to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear him to leave me like this!&rdquo; cried
Connie. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t listen to me. I don&rsquo;t believe
he wants me to be happy!&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
&ldquo;Just a moment, Noel,&rdquo; said Madame Claire.
&ldquo;May I have a word in your private ear? You
won&rsquo;t mind, will you, Connie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They went a few paces down the hall, away
from the sitting room door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie wrote me about it last night,&rdquo; said
Madame Claire. &ldquo;I received her note this morning.
I had an idea you would be here, and I
meant to kill two birds with one stone if possible.
I suppose she&rsquo;s serious about this &hellip; this marriage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she means to marry him right enough,&rdquo;
said Noel, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see any way of preventing
it. Short of fighting a duel. Hang it all&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; interrupted Madame Claire
speaking very slowly and thoughtfully, &ldquo;I wonder
whatever became of that little German wife
of his?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The one he had when he ran off with Connie?
Dead, I suppose. Or divorced.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think neither,&rdquo; she replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had some correspondence with her at the
time,&rdquo; said Madame Claire, tracing a pattern on
the carpet with her stick. &ldquo;It was after Leonard
Humphries was killed in South Africa. I wrote
to her&mdash;by an odd coincidence I found out where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
she lived&mdash;and asked her if she would divorce
Petrovitch. I have her answer here.&rdquo; She
touched the bag she carried. &ldquo;She lived in an
obscure village in South Germany, was an ardent
Roman Catholic, and of course had no intention
of divorcing him. She went on to say that it was
also extremely unlikely that she would die, as
she came of a long-lived family and enjoyed
excellent health. It was really quite an amusing
letter. I think the woman had character. And
I think she still has.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him as she leaned on her stick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; exclaimed Noel. &ldquo;A bigamist,
eh? Claire, you&rsquo;re a double-eyed sorceress. I
believe there&rsquo;s something in it. Will you give
me the letter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; She took it out of her bag and gave
it to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to Connie yet. I&rsquo;m going
to try a bit of bluff on old What&rsquo;s-His-Name.
Of course she may be dead as mutton, but on the
other hand she may not, as you say. Claire, you
are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Words failed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; remarked Madame
Claire. &ldquo;Be careful of Petrovitch, and don&rsquo;t say
anything libelous. See what you can find out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
But I can trust you to manage the affair. By the
way, is Judy&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel nodded, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless her! That&rsquo;s really delightful! Stephen
will be so pleased. I dare say I shall see her this
afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She returned to Connie, and Noel, much excited,
made his way with all speed to Claridge&rsquo;s,
reading the letter as he went. At the hotel he
wrote on his card:
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;I would like to see you on a matter that concerns
you and your immediate plans.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>


<p>
In a few moments he was shown upstairs to
Petrovitch&rsquo;s rooms.
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch was standing frowning at the card
in the middle of a large and beautifully furnished
sitting room. He threw up his head as an animal
does when Noel entered, and his protruding lips
widened in an unpleasant smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! It is the nephew! The charming aunt&rsquo;s
charming nephew. I guessed as much. Well?
You have come to say, &lsquo;Hands off!&rsquo; eh? Am I
right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly correct,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;That saves
me a lot of trouble. I merely dropped in to let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
you know that the marriage will not take place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Petrovitch, rubbing his hands.
&ldquo;That is good. That is excellent. You are&mdash;what
do they say&mdash;the heavy father, eh? The
Countess, you will say, is not of age. She does
not know her mind.&rdquo; He laughed mirthlessly.
&ldquo;Well, I will risk all that, venerable sir!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be risking more than that,&rdquo; said Noel
evenly. &ldquo;By the way, may I sit down? I think
if we both sit down&mdash;thank you. As I said
before, I simply came in to tell you that the
marriage will not take place. I expect you to
give me your word of honor before I leave this
room that you will not attempt to see Countess
Chiozzi again on any pretext whatsoever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My good young man,&rdquo; said Petrovitch, too
much amused to be angry, &ldquo;I will see your aunt,
Countess Chiozzi, where and when I please, and
I will marry her by special license the day after
to-morrow. What have you to say to that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only that it will have to be a very special
license.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know what you mean by that. But
one thing I do know very well, and that is that
even if I did not wish to marry your aunt before,
I would do so now simply because you do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
wish it. I do not speak English well, but I think
I have made my meaning clear, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite clear. I hope you are as well acquainted
with the English law as you are with the English
language.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why should I know English law?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Was he looking the least bit uncomfortable?
Noel prayed that no sign, no clue might escape
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It might come in useful. We&rsquo;re a funny
people. To run off with some one else&rsquo;s wife is
not, of course, a criminal offense. But there is
one thing that the law absolutely draws the line
at. I wonder if you know what that one thing is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Petrovitch looking at
his watch, &ldquo;and neither do I care. I am to meet
your delightful aunt at her hotel at one o&rsquo;clock,
and it is now a quarter to that hour. If you will
excuse me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In connection with that thing that I have not
yet named,&rdquo; went on Noel, &ldquo;I want you to know
that I am going to Germany at nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
morning. Here are my passports.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Touch&eacute;!</span>
There was not the slightest doubt
about it now. Petrovitch was on his feet, his
heavy head down like that of a charging buffalo,
his brows drawn together, his lips thrust out.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
&ldquo;What do you mean, you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His hands gripped the chair back. Noel went
on in that casual, calm way of his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Petrovitch, I&rsquo;m not going to make
a row if I can help it. I hate the whole business.
You leave Connie alone, and you&rsquo;ll never hear
of this again. Only&mdash;I know what I know, and
if you force me to do it, I&rsquo;ll be obliged to produce
all the necessary proofs, and you&rsquo;ll be&mdash;dished.
It&rsquo;s an ugly affair, and it would mean I don&rsquo;t
know how many years for you. Candidly now,
is it worth it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch went a queer color and sat down
suddenly. He had evidently changed his mind
about throwing anything. Noel felt drunk with
the wine of complete and unexpected success. He
wondered what he would have done in Petrovitch&rsquo;s
place, and decided that he would have
brazened it out to the very end. Not so Petrovitch,
evidently. His rage had gone as quickly
as it had come. But what Noel saw in his face
was not fear. No, it was certainly not fear.
What was it?
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch stared at him for some moments,
and then said quite simply:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is alive, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great snakes!&rdquo; Noel said to himself. &ldquo;Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve brought her to life!&rdquo; But his brain
worked quickly. He touched his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a letter from her here,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch did not even ask to see it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the same old place. She has never been out
of it all these years. Why don&rsquo;t you go there
and look her up the next chance you get? Do you
know&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his chair forward an inch or
two&mdash;&ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;s still fond of you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch straightened himself and passed a
hand over his forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wrote her many letters. She has never
replied. I thought she&mdash;I believed she was dead.
During the war I could not go to Germany. I
have not heard from her in twelve years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said Noel, &ldquo;she hadn&rsquo;t every
reason to be pleased with you, had she? You
know what wives are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man was almost himself again. He
shrugged his shoulders and thrust out his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what all women are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noel nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. Perfectly true. Well &hellip; she&rsquo;s been
a good wife to you, Petrovitch. She&rsquo;s let you go
your own way, she&rsquo;s never bothered you. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
were to go back to her, I believe she&rsquo;d welcome
you with open arms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor Freda.&hellip; I believe she would.
She was a good woman, a good wife. Little
Freda! Some day, who knows?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; echoed Noel. &ldquo;You might do
worse, Petrovitch. Think it over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Freda alive! Freda alive!&rdquo; Petrovitch kept
repeating. &ldquo;My little Freda!&rdquo; He turned to
Noel. &ldquo;You have saved me from crime. From
crime against the law, and against that good
woman who still loves me. I thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Noel, almost overcome
by a variety of emotions. To himself he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to like this fellow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He got up and held out his hand. Petrovitch
also rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I must leave you now.
Er &hellip; about Connie &hellip; she&rsquo;ll feel this, of
course, but I think I can make all the necessary
explanations. Will you trust me to break it to
her as gently as possible? Naturally, I&rsquo;ve said
nothing to her about &hellip; Freda. I didn&rsquo;t feel
I could until I&rsquo;d seen you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you. I will leave everything to you.
Connie has a great heart, and I think she will
not grieve too much if she knows that I but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
return to an old and faithful love. Soon I go
to America to fulfill my engagements, and
then&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Noel. &ldquo;Well, good-by!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; inquired Petrovitch, retaining
his hand, &ldquo;how you came to hear that
Freda&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Noel answered promptly. &ldquo;You
see, years ago, when you and Connie&mdash;well&mdash;just
at that time, my grandmother ran across some
one who knew her&mdash;knew Freda. Naturally, my
grandmother was unhappy about Connie, her
daughter, and thought that possibly a divorce&mdash;you
understand&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So she wrote to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! But my wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly! She wasn&rsquo;t having any. Well, she
kept my grandmother&rsquo;s address, and the other
day, being anxious and unhappy about you, she
naturally thought we might be able to tell her
something, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch made a gesture of the hands that
showed a perfect comprehension, gratitude, sympathy,
a yielding to fate, and a consciousness of
his own power over women, wives and others.
Noel envied him that gesture.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
&ldquo;My poor little Freda!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how it was,&rdquo; Noel concluded.
They shook hands again, strongly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, good luck!&rdquo; said Noel.
</p>

<p>
Petrovitch bowed.
</p>

<p>
They never saw each other again.
</p>

<p>
In the cab, driving back to Connie&rsquo;s quiet little
hotel, Noel wanted to put his head out of the
window and shout to the passers-by. He could
hardly contain himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Freda,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;when I get to Berlin,
whether you&rsquo;re alive or dead I&rsquo;m going to send
you the biggest box of chocolates I can buy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">At</span>
last a day came when Madame Claire received
a wire from Paris:
</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;Arriving London to-night. Feeling very fit.
Have engaged rooms McPherson and self Langham
Hotel. Will see you to-morrow afternoon
about four.
</p>

<p class="closing-signature">&ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
She thought it was one of the most perfect
moments of her life. She could taste to the full,
in one mouthful, so to speak, the different yet
blending flavors of anticipation and realization.
Dawson had never seen her so happily excited,
nor so difficult to please in the matter of flowers
for her room. Judy had wrought this miracle&mdash;had
so revived Stephen&rsquo;s flagging spirits that he
felt at last able to make the journey. Had they
left him alone there in Cannes, he would have
waited dully and hopelessly for another stroke.
He would probably have ended his days there,
without ever returning to England. And now,
anything was possible. She longed to share Noel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
with him, too, Eric, all of them. He might find
something to like in Gordon. He might continue
to find Connie and Connie&rsquo;s vagaries interesting.
They could see each other every day&mdash;or nearly
every day. And when spring came, he could
stay with her in Sussex&mdash;he would love her little
house and her garden&mdash;and they could talk.
There was so much to talk about!
</p>

<p>
She hoped he had made an honest effort to
picture her as she now was. Men were so apt not
to face the facts of change and decay in the
women they loved. Was he still picturing her
as she looked when he last saw her, nearly twenty
years ago? Or&mdash;as is so often the way with age&mdash;was
he seeing her as she was when he first
knew her, before she married Robert? But she
felt she could trust to his common sense about
that. At any rate, he would see her as he had
always seen her, with the eyes of the heart. And
what would he be like? She believed that his
personality&mdash;that indefinable emanation that
makes each one of us different from any other
one&mdash;would be unchanged. To her, nothing else
mattered.
</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * * *</p>


<p>
To-morrow came. She pictured Stephen looking
out of his windows at London, and getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
used to the smell of it again. Madame Claire
was always dressed by eleven except on her bad
days, and to-day, thank Heaven! was not one of
them. From eleven till four&mdash;five hours, five long
hours! Miss McPherson had telephoned that
she would have her patient there by four o&rsquo;clock.
She would leave him at the door, the tactful
creature had said, and go for a walk in the park.
Madame Claire agreed to this, on the condition
that when she came for him again at six, she stay
for half an hour. Miss McPherson would be very
pleased indeed to do so.
</p>

<p>
At four, Madame Claire was dressed in a wine-colored
silk that spread about her stiffly and
richly as she sat in her straight-backed chair. Her
white hair was dressed high, and secured with a
comb of carved shell. She had given much thought
to her appearance. She kept beside her an old
ebony stick of Robert&rsquo;s, for her rheumatism made
it a little difficult for her to rise. On the other
side of the wood fire was another chair, carefully
placed so that the light would fall on the face of
the occupant, but not too strongly for his comfort.
The room was full of flowers; early tulips,
richly dyed anemones, and here and there her
beloved freesias. On a small table at her right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
hand lay an inlaid box, and the key to it hung on
a bracelet she wore on her wrist.
</p>

<p>
A bell rang, and she sat motionless, hardly
moving her eyelids. Stephen &hellip; Stephen was at
her door &hellip; fate was kind &hellip; this was her
moment of moments, her day of days.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and Dawson said in a strange
voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. de Lisle, m&rsquo;lady,&rdquo; and vanished.
</p>

<p>
And Stephen came to her.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
They brushed each other&rsquo;s cheeks lightly, for
the first time in their long lives. They moved
the two chairs nearer together and sat with
clasped hands. Words for a time were beyond
them, but at last Stephen spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are wonderful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wonderful,
wonderful!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; cried Madame Claire. &ldquo;I
was prepared for some one much older, some one
bent and feeble &hellip; you are so straight!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As long as the Lord lets me walk at all,&rdquo;
he told her, &ldquo;I hope He&rsquo;ll let me walk upright.
And I&rsquo;m better &hellip; much better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How I have longed for this!&rdquo; Her voice
rang out clearly. &ldquo;My dear, stubborn, too proud
old Stephen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Less stubborn now, but still proud. Claire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
you always had delightful ways. It&rsquo;s your ways
that have always held me&mdash;and your wits. But
how have you managed to become beautiful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beautiful? My poor old Stephen&mdash;your
eyes&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As good as they ever were, except for reading.
No, you&rsquo;ve got something new &hellip; what
is it? Dignity, that&rsquo;s it. You were always too
gentle, too shy, to be properly dignified.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was always shy,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;until lately.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I adored your shyness. A gentle, soft-voiced
thing you were. Clever &hellip; devilish clever! How
you managed Robert! And me. And all the
chattering, brilliant, stupid, charming people of
our day. You managed &rsquo;em all. And nobody
knew it, but me. I used to tell Robert he&rsquo;d have
been a government clerk somewhere, but for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was untrue, for Robert had
wit and a good brain. His fault was that he
didn&rsquo;t understand people. He wasn&rsquo;t human
enough. I could help him there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you did help him. You made him; say
what you will. You would have made any man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They talked&mdash;how they talked! Never taking
their eyes off each other&rsquo;s faces. Remembering
things that they had half forgotten, things that
it took the two of them together to remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
completely. Stopping in their talk every now and
then to smile at each other, to realize that this
longed-for thing had come to pass. To savor
these moments, these perfect, winged moments,
that would never be less than perfect; moments
that Time had brought to a fine flowering&mdash;&ldquo;Without
the end of fruit&rdquo;&mdash;without the end of
disillusion, too, and what scent that flowering
had! No, there could be no falling off, no dimming
of that brightness. They could trust to
Death for that. Their curtain would be rung
down on a fine gesture, on a perfect note.
</p>

<p>
And then back to Robert again, and his qualities
that Stephen so much admired. They could
even talk of him, frankly and simply. Twenty
years ago he had been too near, his claim to be
regarded as an absent friend, merely, had been
too great. But now&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think he appreciated you, Claire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he had not&mdash;but he did. I have always
remembered that. And he made you happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She lifted her head and looked squarely at him,
holding his eyes with hers, steadily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I made myself happy,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was not much time left to them. Let it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
be a completely happy time, free of all pretense,
of all misunderstanding. She wanted no secrets
from Stephen now. Even if she did Robert the
least injustice, his spirit must have reached heights
of magnanimity very far beyond the reach of
such truths as were mere earthly truths. She
owed something to the living, and to her own
spirit. She had kept her secret well. She meant
to permit herself the inestimable luxury of sharing
it now with Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean&mdash;I made myself as happy as a woman
can be who is not married to the man she loves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had felt, when she looked at him so
strangely, that he was on the brink of some new
knowledge. He almost dreaded what that knowledge
might be&mdash;dreaded the pain it might bring.
He had hardly grasped her meaning yet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Claire! Then why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;? Good
God&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She released the hand that he had clung to,
and unfastened the little gold key that hung from
her wrist. She took the inlaid box on her knees
and opened it, Stephen watching her every movement.
The box was lined with red velvet and
contained a single letter, yellow with age. She
took it out, delicately, and turned it over in her
fingers so that he saw both sides of it. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
unopened. The heavy seal on the flap of the
envelope was unbroken. She gave him the letter
without a word.
</p>

<p>
He studied it for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My writing!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Claire, what
is this? What letter is this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That letter,&rdquo; she said gently, putting a hand
on his arm, &ldquo;is a proposal from the man I loved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, uncomprehending.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will tell you about it,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fifty-six years ago, Stephen, when that letter
was written, I had two admirers. Oh, more, perhaps
but only two that counted. They were you
and Robert. Robert was serious and clever, and
very much in love with himself, and you were&mdash;everything
that the heart of a girl like me could
desire. You were friends, you two; you were
rivals, but friends for all that. You were the
better lover, Robert the more ingenious wooer.
Robert out-maneuvered you. It was he who got
most of my dances at balls, but it was always you
I longed to give them to. It was Robert who
won the approval of my mother and father; it
was you who won mine. He was said to be a
coming young man. They told me that you lacked
ambition and force&mdash;even in those days people
talked about force&mdash;but it was you I loved. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
told my father that you wanted to marry me, and
he said you were too young for me. You were
only twenty-two, and I was twenty-three. He persuaded
you to make the Grand Tour before settling
anything. You told him you would not go
without speaking to me. And you tried to speak
to me&mdash;how often you tried!&mdash;but we were never
left alone in those days. My mother was fearful,
for Robert, and Robert was fearful for himself.
So there were always interruptions. You were
almost maddened by them, and I&mdash;I was eating
my heart out. If you could only have passed me
on the stairs and whispered, &lsquo;Marry me!&rsquo; I would
have said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; But the chance never came.
And I&mdash;little fool&mdash;was too shy to make it. And
then, on the very eve of your Grand Tour, you
wrote me this letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had almost despaired of your ever speaking.
I was hurt and miserable. Robert redoubled his
efforts. And then one day he came to the house&mdash;it
was the day he meant to propose, and I knew
that my mother meant to receive him with me and
then excuse herself, leaving us together. It was
the day before you were to go away, and I longed
for any word or sign from you.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You sent this letter, by hand. It reached the
house at the same moment that Robert did. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
saw that it was from you, and he guessed, and
was jealous and afraid. He told the maid that
he would give it to me upstairs, and that as I
was expecting him she needn&rsquo;t announce him.
Stephen&mdash;he put the letter in his pocket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen made a sudden movement and leaned
nearer to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said in a voice that was hardly
more than a whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He kept it in his pocket. Yes, Robert did
that. I, hearing nothing, thought you indifferent,
and my heart seemed to break. He proposed to
me that afternoon, and the next evening, knowing
that you had indeed gone without a word, I gave
him the answer he wanted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused a moment, looking into the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wrote to you to tell you of my engagement.
You must have considered that the letter I wrote
to you then was in answer to the one you had
sent me. You thought that Robert had won
fairly, and blamed yourself. When you came
back, Robert and I were already married, and
you resumed your friendship with him and with
me. And I pretended&mdash;how well I pretended you
know&mdash;that you were no more to me than my
husband&rsquo;s friend. And you were the soul of
honor, Stephen, for although I knew you still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
loved me&mdash;I knew it the moment I saw you again&mdash;never
by one word or look did you try to show
me that you did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I look back now, it seems to me that I saw
almost as much of you as I did of Robert. We
were always together, we three. I used to try to
marry you to my friends, but although you were
always charming to them, you were never more
than that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then, years later, Robert was made
ambassador to Italy. It was a tremendous step
up, and you rejoiced with us, as you always did
at our good fortune. The first year we were in
Rome, Robert was very ill with fever. He
thought he was going to die. He was always apt
to exaggerate his illnesses. He told me he had
something on his mind, and he gave me your letter,
and told me what he had done. I forgave him,
I had to forgive him, and we never spoke of it
again. But I never dared to read it, Stephen.
I put it away in this box. I didn&rsquo;t dare to open
that wound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was silence again. Stephen felt he could
say nothing. Robert had been his closest friend&mdash;they
had been like brothers&mdash;and he had done
this! What was there for him to say?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am telling you this now,&rdquo; Madame Claire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
went on, &ldquo;because I want the time that remains
to us to be as perfect as possible. I want you to
know that while I was a good and faithful wife
to Robert, and made him, I believe, very happy,
I loved you. I bear him no ill will. He acted
according to his lights, believing, then, that all
was fair in love. That doesn&rsquo;t make his act less
detestable, but I must weigh in the scales against
that, the fact that he was the best of husbands
and fathers. And I forgave him absolutely. But,
oh, Stephen&mdash;&mdash;! All those years &hellip; all those
years were one long struggle against my love for
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There are moments too great or too poignant
for speech. He did not know, then, whether the
pain or the happiness of this new knowledge was
the stronger. For a moment the pain had the
upper hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a tragedy!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;A tragedy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently he turned to her again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But when he died?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;When I
came to you again? Why did you say no?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire hesitated before she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My reasons,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;may have seemed to
you to be poor ones. I pleaded my age, I remember,
and the fact&mdash;or what I believed was a fact&mdash;that
it would have been an elderly folly for us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
to have married then. But there was another
reason, and a better one. Stephen &hellip; I dreaded
an anti-climax. And it would have been that.
After loving you all my life, all my youth, to have
married you at sixty &hellip; it seemed to me a desecration.
I hoped for a dear friendship with you.
It was that I longed for. But you were angry and
hurt. You left me. I thought you would be
gone six months, or possibly a year. You were
away nearly twenty years!&hellip; Oh, Stephen!&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His eyes begged her forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always tried to think that you were right,
Claire,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Right or wrong, it all
belongs to the past now. So does my loneliness.
I have been lonely, but I can bear that too, now
that I know I have been loved. That sheds a
glory on my life &hellip; a glory.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice sank. She watched him turning the
letter over in his hands, remembering &hellip; remembering.
Then, with a gesture full of courtliness
and charm, he held it out to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Read it, my dear, now,&rdquo; he said.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&ldquo;Veux
tu, toi?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Late</span>
September had come, with its sad, too-mellow
beauty. It had ripened all the fruit,
burnishing the apples to look like little suns, and
the sun to look like a ripe, burnished apple. It
had woven its web of blue over all the still countryside,
so that the elms standing so nobly in the
Sussex meadows seemed draped in it, like tapestry
trees; the far hills had wrapped themselves in its
hazy folds and gone to sleep until some cold and
later wind should strip them of it.
</p>

<p>
In Madame Claire&rsquo;s garden a few roses
bloomed somewhat blowsily, and asters and
Michaelmas daisies, dahlias and a brave company
of late-staying perennials made welcome color
notes among the greens and rust browns.
</p>

<p>
She sat in her library, writing. Every now and
then she looked out of her French window at
Stephen who was sitting on the lawn in one of the
garden chairs, reading, his long legs resting on
another. Robins visited him, perching on a chair
or table, and he thought as his sunken blue eyes
regarded them humorously, that the robin was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
more like a confiding little animal than a bird,
with its friendly ways, and its power&mdash;shared
with no other small bird&mdash;of meeting the human
eye.
</p>

<p>
He had lived in some of the beauty spots of the
world, but he said to himself that no beauty crept
into the heart as this beauty of Sussex did.
Mingled with it was some of the charm of what
was lovable in human nature&mdash;the charm of gentleness
and quiet and homeliness. Every wind was
tempered, the sun shone through a protecting
haze, the verdure harbored nothing more treacherous
than a fluttering moth. To an eye accustomed
to the white and blue glare of the South,
every tint, every color seemed happily blended.
And even the robins, he thought, returning to his
book, seemed to know and like him.
</p>

<p>
Madame Claire was writing to Noel.
</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="letter-body">
<p>
&ldquo;I have often pointed out to you,&rdquo;
<span class="narration-of-letter">she wrote,</span>
&ldquo;the enormous advantages of old age over youth,
but I have never felt them more keenly myself
than now. The world is at present in a state of
flux, and that state, while it may be beneficial, is
rarely comfortable. There are movements afoot
that I am sure cause young mothers to wonder
fearfully what precarious and troubled lives are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
in store for their little ones. I am not one of
those who believe blindly that all new movements
are good ones. The world has seen many that
seemed great, happily defeat their own ends,
leaving the generations to come a legacy of knowledge
that they seem, often enough, to ignore. I
believe that the struggle will be fierce, but the
world, in order to attend to the enormously important
businesses of increasing, eating and sleeping,
requires in the long run certain conventions
and conformities, and to preserve these has a way
of weakening the ground under the feet of the
shouting and bloodthirsty reformer&mdash;even, alas!
of the true spiritual leader. The world has dedicated
itself, I think, to the great law of average&mdash;such
an eternal warring of good and bad would
seem to bring that about naturally&mdash;and compromise
would be the inevitable end of every struggle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You, and all those I love, will either be participators
in or spectators of that struggle. Not
so Stephen and myself. We are privileged by old
age to ignore it if we can. Age has a right to
forget the evils that it can do nothing to lessen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I still read my paper, but I get no pleasure
from it. Who does? One sees that the Empire
for which one would cheerfully die, is accused of
making mistakes in every quarter of the globe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
One hears of millions of helpless people in another
country brought to starvation through a fiendish
conspiracy of greed unexampled in the world&rsquo;s
cruel history. It is one long tale of dissatisfaction
and dissent, and it were better not to have
turned a single page.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But let us leave all that and talk of people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you came back for Judy&rsquo;s wedding in
June, Eric and Louise were still living apart,
though they came together of necessity on that
occasion; and things looked hopeless. But Eric,
as I suppose you must have heard by now, had
a breakdown brought on from overwork. He
had made, I think, a hundred and forty speeches in
eight months, and traveled I forget how many
thousand miles. His fight with the
<dfn title="Independent Labor Party">I.L.P.</dfn> over
the Moorgate Division was a great fight and he
defeated them all along the line. But the strain
was too much for him. Louise was at Mistley
when he was taken ill, and Connie was still keeping
house for him. She hurried him off to a nursing
home, and wrote Louise a scathing letter which
brought that lady hot-foot to London. The two
met for the first time over the sickbed, and oddly
enough, neither dislikes the other as much as they
had expected to. Connie had given such a bad
account of Eric that I believe Louise came to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
a deathbed forgiveness. At any rate, she completely
broke down and sobbed out her remorse
on his pillow, while Connie and the nurse stood
in the hall and tried not to hear. Eric accepted
her repentance and forgave her on the sole condition
that she maintain that same friendly attitude
when he was well again. That, and that
alone he insisted upon, that she treat him like a
friend instead of an enemy. This she gave him
to understand she would do, and they are now
convalescing together&mdash;for in a sense Louise must
be convalescing too&mdash;in Chip&rsquo;s cottage in Cornwall,
looked after by an old Cornish woman. I
had a letter from her yesterday, and she says she
has never been so happy in her life. That is because
she has him entirely to herself, and there is
no one there who could possibly interest him more
than she does. So far so good. What will happen
when he is at work again, surrounded by
people who make claims upon him, I do not know.
But I do feel certain that things can never be as
bad again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie of course is merely marking time till
your return. She has lately made a number of
perfectly desirable acquaintances, however, and
is not in the least unhappy. I think her thankfulness
at her narrow escape from a bigamous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
(?) marriage keeps her from cavilling at her fate,
or from dwelling on her inexplicable infatuation
for Petrovitch, who is in America. For she is
not cured of that, nor will she ever be. He is,
as you once said, her hero for life, spots and all.
That is the r&ocirc;le she has chosen for herself, and
she will play it to the end. I am longing to know
whether or not you have been able to find any
traces of Freda. I sometimes feel that you and
I played a not altogether worthy part in that
affair, but it was worth it!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ask me for minute particulars concerning
Judy. Is she happy, you ask? What am I to
say to that? If she is not happy, she will always
be too loyal to say so. I think she is clever enough
to make her own happiness, or at least to attain
to an average of contentment&mdash;an average that
leans at moments toward the peaks of happiness
on one side and toward the abyss of unhappiness
on the other. And I think it is good for us to
look both ways. Her love for Chip&mdash;and a very
real love it is&mdash;has much in it of the maternal, a
quality I think every woman&rsquo;s love is the better
for. As for him&mdash;dear, simple Chip!&mdash;he worships
her, and is unutterably happy. He may disappoint
her in some ways. He lacks and will
always lack&mdash;in spite of the miracle of her love&mdash;self-confidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
He is never quite comfortable
with strangers, and never expects to be liked,
though when he finds that he is, he glows like a
nice child that is justly praised. If fame ever
comes to Chip it will come in spite of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judy has made their small flat a really delightful
place, but entertaining, except in the most
informal way, is of course impossible. No one
thinks less of human pomps than I do, but given
different opportunities, Judy might have been
something of a Mademoiselle de Lespinasse. Her
charm is extraordinary. She has &lsquo;come out&rsquo; wonderfully
since her marriage, and it is easy to see
that she will develop into an uncommon woman.
If Chip will only develop with her&mdash;but I pray
that he will.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That little cottage in Cornwall that played
such an important part in their lives was the right
setting for their honeymoon, for they had much
to learn about each other. You say that however
it turns out, you are bound to feel partly responsible.
Possibly; but that lovable and gentle face
of Chip&rsquo;s with the lights shining through the fog
upon it, was far more responsible. Judy was
bound to love him. And whether she be happy
or not, she will be all the better for loving him.
We make too much of happiness, Noel. It doesn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
much matter what our lives are; but it does matter
whether or not we live them finely. And that is
possible to any of us. A certain style is necessary
for this; a certain gallant attitude. One finds this
style, this gallantry, in the most unlooked-for
places sometimes&mdash;&mdash;

&ldquo;And just now, I think, is the right moment for
me to speak of Mr. Colebridge. In spite of his
undeniable limitations he loved Judy sincerely,
and he has proved it in a most agreeable way.
You remember I wrote you some time ago that I
had been reading Chip&rsquo;s plays. There were three,
and two of them are charming&mdash;really charming.
I imagine Chip&rsquo;s knowledge of women to have
been extremely slight, but the ladies who existed
in his imagination are really the most delightful
creatures! Delightful! These two plays that I
like so much are fanciful, but at the same time
they are wonderfully sympathetic and human, and
I feel absolutely certain that given half a chance
they are bound to succeed. I at once gave them
to Mr. Colebridge to read&mdash;he owns theaters,
you know&mdash;and although he says he knows nothing
about plays, I mistrust him, for he knew
enough to appreciate these. He is taking them
to New York with him soon, and launched and
extensively advertised by him, I feel sure they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
flourish. He seems to know the very actors and
actresses for the leading parts. Isn&rsquo;t it lucky?
Mr. Colebridge seems almost as pleased about it
as I am myself. Judy says he is doing it for me,
but of course that&rsquo;s nonsense. He says he has
no doubt that the plays will put Judy and Chip
&lsquo;on Easy Street.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now that I call gallant. To make your rival&rsquo;s
fortune is not the end and aim of most disappointed
lovers. There is style about that. I like
Mr. Colebridge. He comes here quite often to
see Stephen and me, and while I admit that I like
him and&mdash;yes&mdash;even admire him, I do not, I confess,
like him best when he is sitting in my garden,
oblivious to its beauties and to the cajoleries of a
most divine autumn, talking about sugar stocks.
I like him better when he has gone, and I think
how good-natured it was of him to have come,
and how nice he really is.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chip&rsquo;s book on religions is in the hands of
the publishers at last. I haven&rsquo;t read it. Neither
has Judy. He is extraordinarily shy and sensitive
about it, and Judy says she has twice saved it
from destruction at his hands. I feel it must be
good. It may even be great! Well, we shall
know some day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little about Gordon that I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
find to say. I know that he had set his heart on
a house in Mayfair, and that Helen had decided
on one in Bloomsbury, near certain friends of
hers; Bloomsbury, as you know, having become
the fashion with a set of people whom Helen
considers very desirable. I guessed what that
high nose and long, unbeautiful chin indicated.
Millie and John tactfully sided with both, for
they feel that while Gordon is of course perfect,
Helen can do no wrong. The little comedy has
amused me considerably, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

<p>
Stephen was calling to her. She put down her
pen and stepped out of the French window. She
crossed the lawn with a pleasant rustle of long
gray skirts, and he got out of his chair as she
came toward him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you been doing all this long
time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Writing to Noel,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Have I
neglected you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was beginning to think so. Come and take
a walk round the garden with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is Miss McPherson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s perpetrating one of her atrocious and
painstaking water colors in the lane.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you tell her they are beautiful!&rdquo;
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way I can make her blush.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked between herbaceous borders
where dying colors burned with the deep, concentrated
brilliance of embers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never loved an autumn as I have loved
this one,&rdquo; Stephen said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor I. Do you know why that is, Stephen?
It&rsquo;s because we are untroubled by thoughts of
other autumns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps. I don&rsquo;t mind your saying those
things as I once did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the fever,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;has gone out of
life. Each day is a little book of hours. The
opening and closing of each flower is an event of
prime and beautiful importance. The shape and
movement of clouds, the flight of birds, the
shadows of the leaves on the grass&mdash;all those
things and a thousand other lovely things are
beginning to assume a right proportion in our
lives. We are beginning to be happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wonderful peace of it all,&rdquo; said
Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. The peace of old age is something I
have looked forward to all my life. That, and
the dignity of it.&rdquo; She looked up at him, smiling.
&ldquo;For old age, Stephen, my dear, is almost as
dignified as death.&rdquo;

        </div>

<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<p>
Welcome to Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s edition of <cite>Madame
Claire</cite>, a novel by Susan Ertz.
</p>
<h4>About the Author.</h4>
<p>Susan Ertz published over twenty works in a
career spanning six decades.  She was born
February 13, 1887 and died on April 11, 1985.
<cite>Madame Claire</cite> was her first novel.
</p>
<h4>This Project Gutenberg version.</h4>
<p>
This production of the book is based on the
first American edition of the novel,
published in 1923, by D. Appleton and Company.
The source is the scanned copy of the Library of
Congress from the Internet Archives.
</p>

<h3>Detailed Notes.</h3>
<p>One major issue in the transcription of this
book is the rendering of words hyphenated and
split between two lines for spacing.  For most
cases, words were silently rejoined based on other
uses of the word in this novel.  Cases where
there are few or no other uses of the word
are detailed in the Hyphenated Words section
of these Detailed Notes.  I used Google&rsquo;s
Ngram viewer
when the book had no template.  There were a few
cases where I&rsquo;d love to check the author&rsquo;s other
novels for templates but her other works are not
digitized. Any other issues in rejoining these words
may also be found in the Hyphenated Words
section.
</p>
<p>
Other issues that have come up in transcribing
the book are listed in the Emendations and
Issues section of these Detailed Notes.
</p>

<h4>Emendations and Issues.</h4>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="#Page_089">Page 89</a> and <a href="#Page_211">Page 211</a>,
there is a space between an em-dash and the beginning of the
next sentence on the printed page. These spaces were removed.</li>
<li><a href="#Page_002">Page 2</a>  The novel uses <b>sitting-room</b>
here but four other times uses <b>sitting room.</b> The novel also uses
dining-room on <a href="#Page_028">Page 28</a>, but later has three
uses of dining room.  In both cases, the spelling as the
novel had it was retained. </li>
<li><a href="#Page_058">Page 58</a> and <a href="#Page_141">Page 141</a>
use <b>well-known</b> and <b>well known,</b> respectively, but the usage in both cases follows
current styling guidelines.  The Chicago Manual of Style cites the following grammatical
rule: use a hyphen to join two or more words serving as a single adjective before a noun,
but not when those two words come after a noun.  The AP Style Guide has a more complex
rule that hyphenates the words after the noun if the adjectives appear after a form of
<b>to be</b>.  In the first sentence, <b>by a well-known firm of decorators,</b> well-known is a
single adjective before a noun.  In the second sentence,  <b>His father, Graham Crosby,
an explorer well known to geographical societies,</b> well known is a single adjective after
the noun explorer, not followed by a verb form of to be.  </li>
<li><a href="#Page_iii">Page iii</a> On the original
title page, the city of Publication and the year of
Publication were on the same line.  Because of a technical issue
associated with maintaining that structure, the city and year are
displayed on separate lines and the text centered, much like the
presentation of this publisher information on the title page of
many of our other books. </li>
<li><a href="#Page_v">Page v</a> Added Table of Contents.  This
table of contents page replaces a simple page with the title
of the novel printed on it.</li>
<li><a href="#Page_027">Page 27</a>, <a href="#Page_149">Page 149</a>.
As the complimentary closing of all other letters was italicized,
the complimentary closings for these two letters were italicized too.
These were Stephen&rsquo;s second letter in Chapter 3 and Claire&rsquo;s reply
to another of Stephen&rsquo;s letters in Chapter 13.
</li>
<li>On <a href="#Page_172">Page 172</a>, the closing signatures of Stephen&rsquo;s
letter was printed on the last line of the letter in the book and right
justified. On <a href="#Page_265">Page 265</a>, the complimentary closing and
closing signature were printed on the last line of the letter and right justified.
Both presentations were standardized.
</li>
<li><a href="#Page_053">Page 53</a> Titanic in Stephen&rsquo;s letter is
in quotes, while <i>Titanic</i> on <a href="#Page_153">Page 153</a>
is italicized.</li>
<li><cite>Who&rsquo;s Who</cite> is a reference work on contemporary prominent
people in Britain published annually since 1849. I removed the
question mark after <cite>Who&rsquo;s Who?</cite> in the citation on
<a href="#Page_240">Page 240</a>.  No change was made to the citation
on <a href="#Page_075">Page 75</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="#Page_165">Page 165</a> Correct spelling of trying in this
sentence: <b>If I say anything she will only
tell me I am tryng to rob her of her happiness.</b></li>
<li><a href="#Page_187">Page 187</a> Change Is to It in the sentence: <b>Is
isn&rsquo;t as though the children were growing up;</b></li>
<li><a href="#Page_222">Page 222</a> Add a left quote before <b>Mr.
Robinson of Denver.&rsquo;</b></li>
<li><a href="#Page_229">Page 229</a> Remove right double quote after <b>Mr.
Colebridge nearly always joins us.&rdquo;</b></li>
<li><a href="#Page_241">Page 241</a> Change pore to poor in the sentence:
<b>there aren&rsquo;t too many things going for a pore cripple.</b></li>
<li>On <a href="#Page_256">Page 256</a> Madame Claire says <b>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</b>
while on <a href="#Page_294">Page 294</a> Chip says <b>shan&rsquo;t</b>.
</li>
<li><a href="#Page_263">Page 263</a> Remove the double right quote after me
in the following sentence: <b>I feel that life is just beginning
for me.</b>  The standard in this book for letters with a closing address
is to defer the trailing right quote until after the closing signature.</li>
<li><a href="#Page_274">Page 274</a> Change single right quote to a double right
quote in the following sentence: <b>"Didn&rsquo;t I understand Judy to say that the
theater was one of them?&rsquo;</b></li>
<li><a href="#Page_277">Page 277</a> Change prefectly to perfectly in the
sentence: <b>"are you prefectly well again?</b></li>
<li><a href="#Page_283">Page 283</a> Change the double right closing quote
after Andrew Crobsy&rsquo;s signature to a closing single right quote.
Judy&rsquo;s narration continues after the end of the letter.</li>
<li>In the <a href="#linkChapter27">Novels promotional page</a>, the
book&rsquo;s practice of putting both publishing cities on
the same line were retained.</li>
<li>The cover image was created by the transcriber and
it is placed in the public domain.</li>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
